2526,Steigenberger Wiltcher's,"Location is great!
Nice building!","Swimming pool is not from the hotel so we had to pay 25$ extra per person per day. Very arrogant and impolite staff at the spa desk, first thing they said was to complain at the hotel reception because they don't belong to the hotel.. 
They misguide people with swimming pool pictures on booking.. small letters than say ""extra charge"" ! They should really change this and just say they don't have a swimming pool or make better agreements with the operational company in charge of the spa.. 
Very disappointing.  ",4
1471,Steigenberger Wiltcher's,Great breakfast,"The elevators were half broken and we couldn't get a good signal on any of the tv channels. When we went to aspire for a spa time they didn't tell us they had water gymnastics on, which really ruined an hour of our stay at the spa. They should have informed us about It beforehand.",8.3
1495,Steigenberger Wiltcher's,The staff was very professional and they make everything to make you comfortable I truly recommand this hotel,Nothing,8.8
1367,Steigenberger Wiltcher's,"always a great place to stay. The rooms are wonderful and although the hotel gym is not good at all, one can pay to use the spa downstairs. I would suggest giving guests a discounted rate or not charging though","The only issue I have with the hotel is that in the rooms, the coffee cups they provide are too small and they all only provide plastic stirrers for the coffee. In a world where we are trying to stop the use of single use plastics, this is not at all in tune with the times",10
2541,Steigenberger Wiltcher's,"Not my first time there, but worst time . 
TV: all HD channels are not proper working, blocked or full with mosaic pictures 
Bathroom: who can't clothe it proper.
Room door: the moment you have a draft it's clapping
WC: Water flasher was not working proper
i did mentioned the tv matter 3times at the reception, but nothing better
i did called saturday late afternoon the reception 2times from the room. no response 
my room: 606 avoid the 5th floor
i go back to Hilton Grande Place, it's much better. 
While I checked out, no commercial bargain or so proposed. As I asked the lady for the price from the 11-13tge of decembre, Eur 260 per night so no being sorry we offer y a good price
Sorry to say, ",,7.1

25386,European institutions apartments,"Location was very good. The apartment was spacious and had everything I needed, including an iron and a hair dryer!",The television didn't work properly. It kept switching off itself after couple of hours and the remote control didn't work properly. There was one curtain that did not come down and there was a building on the opposite side so I had to climb on the chair to manually unroll/roll the curtain. Bathroom floor was not cleaned properly. It was a bit cold in the apartment - when I tried to turn up the heating the heaters made so much noise (which did not stop after waiting) so I had to turn it back down.,8

I went next door (hotel) for dinner which was good, inexpensive and convenient. Instructions for key collection on arrival were easy to follow. Location was perfect for my stay.",Cleaning charge for apartment when 1 person staying 1 night is expensive and makes price close to nearby 4 star hotels.,8

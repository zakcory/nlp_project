19340,PREMIER SUITES PLUS Antwerp,,"Waking up at 7:30 because of the hotel renovation. They were destroying the two rooms next to mine.
Too much noise from the street.
An advertising placard from the hotel with two strong lights right next to the window illuminating the room all night. 
There is no hand soap. Some showers flood all your bathroom. 
Sometimes you have water in the fridge, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you have flip flops, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you have a towel for drying the dishes, sometimes you don't. Etc.
Sometimes you find a dirty oven when checking in, sometimes you can find the dishwasher machine with dirty dishes inside.",5
19040,PREMIER SUITES PLUS Antwerp,"The bed was fairly comfortable, front of house staff were polite. Nice facilities in the reception area. Close to shops and restaurants. ",The room was dusty. The room wasn't well sound proofed and so it was difficult to get my 3 year to sleep on Saturday evening. The breakfast left much to be desired in the morning terms if choice. Lots of building work going on which we were not made aware of beforehand. Rubbish on the balcony.,4.6

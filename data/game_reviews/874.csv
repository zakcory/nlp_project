7808,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"The staff and the location of the hostel, they have laundry services and that was good ",Not all the beds have power outlets close to them like other hostels,8
9330,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,The breakfast was very good but can be improved. It was a male-only room and I am amazed how polite the guys were. That has never happened to me while I am/was staying in a mixed room.,"Elevator was not working, for which I complained and the issue got resolved by the staff. No internet in my room, previous time I stayed here, there was very fast internet in my room. Only 2 lockers in the room for 4 people.",5
8964,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"Wi-fi was fast. Toilets and shower inside our room were quite clean. Bathroom had a luxurious feeling compared to the other hostels I've stayed in. Sheets were clean, too.","Matresses and pillows were not that comfortable. Breakfast menu felt a bit poorer, can be improved.",7.9
9228,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,Its was nice and clean and was busy place.,They don't have sockets for individuals.,5.4
9187,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,Location was very good.  Breakfast was reasonable and satisfying.,"The mattress was terrible.  Couldn't get comfortable.  It was like sleeping on a flat board. No accomodation made for those with bad backs.   It would have been nice if there was better lounge facilities if you wanted to take a day to rest from traveling.  The furniture in the lobby although stylish is not conducive to relaxation.  It is too low to the ground and not meant for comfort.  The chairs in the dining room again not good for posture. They were meant for style and esthetics.   For hostel travelers, when entering room at midnight dont flip on lights. Please adhere to lights out at 10pm.  I can not begin to tell you the inconsiderate nature of fellow travelers during my  stay.",4
8357,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"Helpfull staff, great location just 15 min from the city center, bar downstairs. Breakfast didn't give a lot of choices, but i've enjoyed it ","Bathroom and it's cleanliness, the basin faucet needs descaling, same for the shower faucet. Ceiling requires attention, there are dark places all over, looks like some kind of that unhealthy fungus is growing there.",7.9

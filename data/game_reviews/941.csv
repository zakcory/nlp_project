3952,Novotel Brussels City Centre,Location was not bad,"The safe box was not working and I reported it but they didn't fix it.  Moreover, the shower was not working! I had to sleep in the tub to take a shower! 
Also very limited choices in the breakfast and they wanted to charge me Euro 5 for fried eggs which obviously I didn't proceed with the order given that I paid for the breakfast! ",5.4
4110,Novotel Brussels City Centre,Corner room with views was large and quiet. Good bed reading lights. Plenty of in-room coffee provided for Nespresso machine.,"Strange lay-out in a large room. About 1/3 of room bare except for a wardrobe and no illumination. I mentioned to front desk staff but wondered how they would address since could see no electrical outlet in the area and only a dim light over a mirror outside the bathroom. They did nothing.  The toilet is separate in small ""water closet.""  Door opens inward and a challenge for anyone large or not flexible to enter and exit.  One side of the bed was about a foot away from the wall even though there was plenty of room on the other side to allow increase of a foot or more.  The desk/table too could have been larger without crowding.",6.7

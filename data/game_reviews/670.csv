3515,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,Fabulous location by the canal. Room was very large and comfortable.,Limited breakfast,8.3
2629,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Helpful, pleasant staff.  Location.  Two easy chairs and table by window to enjoy the view of the canal.","Bright, flashing (every 15 seconds) LED ceiling smoke alarm unit; it was extremely bright in the dark bedroom and as it was over the bottom of the bed very disturbing.  Poor quality waterproof rubber cover to mattress which was uncomfortable (made me hot) also made a noise everytime we moved.  Rubbish pillows.  Corridor doors (Fire Doors?) constantly propped open for the convenience of builders working.",7.1
1637,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Location is absolutely perfect - a few seconds from the markt and other beauty spots. Room size was great, bed was comfortable, wifi was great. Staff very polite. Value for money good, as the price was very reasonable. Very quiet hotel with no disruption from noise.","Amenities in the bathroom were disappointing. There was literally no holder for the shower head, and no shower curtain or divider. This made it pretty difficult to have a decent shower - constantly had to hold the shower head and have water splashing everywhere. For a hotel of this standard I expected more, people don't want to run a bath in the height of summer or when they just want to get fresh before dinner. Also the size and quality of the provided shampoo and shower gel was very poor, and the towels were quite thin.",7

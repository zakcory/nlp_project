11200,B&B Casablanca,"Very good breakfast and location in the center of Kortrijk, great hospitality of the owner. I fully recommend.",,9.6
11165,B&B Casablanca,"Lovely place full of personality and very clean. The best is the kindness of the owner, the cosyness of the place and the gorgeous breakfast. We will definitely get back everytime we stop in Kortrijk.",Everything was great there,10
11250,B&B Casablanca,Beautiful breakfast and friendly hostess. Good central location,"I was very surprised that there is no door on the en-suite. I expect to be more private on the toilet ! Also, the stairs are steep and difficult if you have reduced mobility",8
11210,B&B Casablanca,My room was comfortable and staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Location was perfect - 10 mins walk from the station and just off the high street.,"Whilst the bed was comfortable, the pillows were rather hard.  The Moroccan feel to the B&B was welcoming and very authentic, but this meant that the lighting in the room was very low.  It would have been nice to have a slightly brighter light in the bathroom, for example.",7.9
11163,B&B Casablanca,"We have been in Casablanca a few times before, and it it always clean, tidy, easy for check in.   Will definitely go back more.",,9
11175,B&B Casablanca,"Short walk from the train station. Really nicely decorated and with everything you need in the room (hairdryer, kettle, etc.). Host was lovely! Such a friendly place to stay. Highly recommend!",Everything was good!,10
11235,B&B Casablanca,"Lady was smiling, offered teas, beers, etc,. but when you are in a bad mood you just want to crash. Especially after not being answered the door multiple times.","Lady does not speak english. Check in is at 16:00! New one to me, and the check out is at 10:00 if you consider the time in between, I might as well sleep on the street.  Nobody was answering the door, was ringing for good 15 minutes. Prior that I visited the property 3x times, nobody was there (in hopes to leave the bag so I can go around the town) ended up carrying all the stuff with me to the exhibition that I needed to see.  Very bad, money driver, will not choose again!",4.6

4471,Alpha Hotel,"Good location 
Cheapest room ",The Beds are not comfortable,6.7
4583,Alpha Hotel,"Good location, friendly staff.","The hotel is bit old and the rooms are not very well sound proof. So you (almost) hear everything - the bags rolling, shower in the adjacent room, people talking. But we were there only for one night so was not a big deal for us. If you are looking for a quite place to stay, probably not the best option.",7.1
4338,Alpha Hotel,"We were allowed to leave our luggages at the reception of the hotel even before the check in time. The location of the hotel is great, very close to the centre and to the beach.",When I made the reservation it was written that a parking was available at the hotel. Once we arrived and asked for the parking we were told that we should have reserved the parking before (but this was not specified neither written anywhere when I made the reservation) so we had to look for an other pay parking in the city.,8

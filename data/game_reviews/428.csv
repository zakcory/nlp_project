12984,De Zon B&B,"Lovely helpful and flexible owners, spacious and clean premises, great value for money.  It's extremely handy to have a fully equipped kitchen in the chalet (it's like a granny flat).  I don't think many other accommodations can offer that in the same area.  We will definitely come back and stay longer next time.",,10
12998,De Zon B&B,"The room is in a self contained building at the rear of the Owner's house. It is a delightful room and fully equipped with everything essential and an awful lot more! There is an excellent Chinese restaurant 3 minutes away by bicycle and a good supermarket 10 minutes away. The pleasant town is a little further but has numerous shops, restaurants and cafes. I'd also like to say how helpful, friendly and ""all round nice"" the Owners are. I was cycling along a route associated with 1940 Prisoners of War and the Owner is both interested in history (across the centuries) and cycling so it was really hard to leave next day!",Nothing!,9.6
13027,De Zon B&B,"This hotel room is a cozy small independent house located in the beautiful small garden. There is lots of nature around here. The hotel is located in the typical rural area of the Flemish region, and it is convenient to visit famous Belgian destinations from here. I spent very quiet and peaceful time from Saturday evening to Sunday morning. In the morning, I enjoyed clear sunshine from the skylight (window in the roof). The owners madam and her husband are so kind. The breakfast was excellent.",,9.2

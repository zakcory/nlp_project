11949,Kokodor,Good location,Toilet in our 2 person room did not have a door at all. This was rather inconvenient with a girlfriend. The stairs were next to the room and it was impossible to sleep in the morning when people were going up and down and speaking loudly at the reception.,6.3
11882,Kokodor,"Warm welcome and great choice for breakfast with fresh fruit salad and boiled eggs, several types of bread. Comfortable beds and nice warm shower.",We were 8 and would have liked a place to play cards or drink a tea before going to bed. During summer there is a nice place outside but during winter this does not fit.,8.3
11916,Kokodor,"The property owners were super friendly and the breakfast was good. The location is good and easy free parking. Close to the beach, the village center, Supermarket and tram stop. Very convenient. The room and linen are very clean.",Unfortunately the bed mattress was not very comfortable especially for someone who has a bad back and walls are pretty thin that we can hear everyone and all noises. If you're a heavy sleeper it's not problematic.,7
11905,Kokodor,"Great location, wonderful breakfast. Great hosts","Large gap about my son's room door. Asked owner to help but says there was nothing he could do. Sandy floor n out room, plus broken tiles in the shower.",6
11938,Kokodor,"Excellent location, friendly staff, clean property.","There were  issues of privacy.  The on- suite toilette has been separated by  just a curtain rather than by a  proper door from our bedroom making it uncomfortable to use the bathroom (the other person had to leave the room to save both partners from the embarrassment). Furthermore, the window of the room  overlooked a public area just arms-length from where other guests were socialising or passing by. This was also uncomfortable as  the window had to be kept open due to high temperature in the room, so we felt quite exposed to the traffic by other guests. Considering these conditions and that breakfast was not included in the price I don't think it was a good value for money.",6.3
11927,Kokodor,"Very nice owners.
Great breakfast.
Convenient location.","Toilet not separated from room.
Same key for entrance and room (all the guests can can access the room!).
Little privacy.

11858,Kokodor,"Very good location, with the supermarket, cafes, banks round the corner, and close to the sea and the coastal tram stop. Very nice owners, pleasant room, pretty patio. Kettle, microwave and cutlery put at the guests' disposal.","Stayed on the ground floor, and could hear a bit the noise from the other rooms, especially from the room above.",8

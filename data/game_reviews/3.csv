13139,S Hertogenmolens Hotel,The property is an old water mill with new wings built on. Our room was in the new part but out adjoining bathroom was in the old part a step down. Quirky but with a certain charm. Nice view of the river. Rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. Free parking and a short walk to the town centre.,Difficult to find due to the road closures that seem to plague Belgian towns.,8

13060,S Hertogenmolens Hotel,"The hotel itself is in a lovely location, and the rooms and interior have kept the rustic feel and decor of the old watermill which the building used to be. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious and comfortable, and the big bath was a HUGE bonus for a weary traveller !","Access to the car park is tricky if you are travelling in anything bigger than an SUV, and would be impossible in anything bigger than a Transit-style minibus, as it involves crossing a narrow bridge which also bends at the end.

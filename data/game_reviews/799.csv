21629,Hotel Mirabeau,"The hotel is a palace in Place Fontainas, just besides the Moeder Lambic. So it's cool to crush there after some nice beer sessions. Staff is cheerful and gentle.","Doesn't smell properly good in the stairwell. Facilities are old and somewhere run-down. Washbasin are small, did they designed for dwarves?",7
22332,Hotel Mirabeau,"Perfect location just 5 minutes from Grand Place, friendly staff, clean rooms.",TV in the room was not fully functional.  Shower is not fully equipped resulting in water leaks out of the shower area to whole bathroom. Apart from that no complaints and recommend to stay.,9.2
22628,Hotel Mirabeau,Location was very close to center!,Wifi was terrible!,7.9
21917,Hotel Mirabeau,"The location was just perfect. It was on a walking distance from most major attractions in the city. There are plenty of cafes, restaurants and shops nearby. It is also very convenient to go back there after walk in order to take a little break and continue. The room was clean and looked pretty much the same as on the pictures.","Our room was in front of main street so it was very noisy. We did need to use ear plugs in order to sleep good. Our bed was supposed to be a big one but instead it was two single ones placed next to each other, which start to separate every time you move. The sink in the bath was very small, so every time you have to wash the water was streaming down the floor.",7.5
21657,Hotel Mirabeau,Staff is very friendly. Close to city center. Good price,My room was without any view and also the noise and talkings coming from the lobby a lot. Bathroom is not so clean. Just check the ventilation device. So many dust. The lamp out of it is place. And i saw hair on the floor.,7.1

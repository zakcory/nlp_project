7443,B&B Bariseele,"The proprietor Benny is a very gracious host. B&B Bariseele was everything we had expected. The breakfast was without a doubt the best we have ever had at any B&B we have stayed at, anywhere. The location is about a 10 minute walk to the heart of Bruges, as well as some of the more suburban areas of the city. We highly recommend B&B Bariseele!",Nothing I can think of!,10

7287,B&B Bariseele,"Great location, a few minutes walk from the main attractions and a supermarket nearby. The property is clean, comfortable and offers ample space (we had a living room and a bedroom). Staff is welcoming, very helpful and makes everything to make you feel at home (they even let us checking early as there was a snow storm when we arrived). And the breakfast!!! Despite COVID measures, they make sure we could enjoy a wonderful breakfast basket put outside our door in the morning.",Wifi is a bit weak and was not always working,9

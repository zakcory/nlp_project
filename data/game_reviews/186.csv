14056,B&B Chester,The B&B is overall beautifully decorated and our suite on the ground floor was very spacious and very pretty. The fireplace was simply amazing and created a romantic atmosphere in the room! The honesty bar was very well equipped and prices were very reasonable. The breakfast has a lot of variety and it was quite tasty.,"There was quite a lot of noise from the street, the stairs and the door of the B&B which sadly is the case for many hotels in cities. The bathroom was a little bit smelly. Breakfast was served by a different person every morning and although everyone was polite, it felt a little bit impersonal. ",8.8

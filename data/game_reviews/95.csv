10868,Apartments Breydelhof,"great location, close to the centre. Electronic entry was very easy to arrange.","LIft broke down, wouldn't use it.",8
10791,Apartments Breydelhof,No keys all door codes,"Larger Microwave bowls for cooking, spoons for stirring  food other than cutlery. Microwave more accessible as it was placed under the work top. Tall people would struggle here as head height was quite restrictive.",8
10798,Apartments Breydelhof,The location of the apartment was perfect. We had a lot of rain so it was nice to be able to pop back from town to warm up. We loved the lighting and the quirkiness.even the stairs to the bedroom which demand a bit of concentration :-),,8
11033,Apartments Breydelhof,The location was just perfect and the use of the bicycles free of charge was great!,My husband is tall - the loft apartment was too low for him. I think the height should be specified on the website.,7.9
10807,Apartments Breydelhof,I loved the layout of the room. It was so central. So clean and tidy.,,10
10784,Apartments Breydelhof,The apartment was spacious and well-decorated with a nice large bed. We wish we could have stayed longer than one night! It's very close to everything as well. It was easy to find and simple to check in.  We will definitely stay here again.,"The wi-fi is quite poor, so you might need to use your own data at times. It can also get a bit noisy at night (people walking home from the bars). The check-out time is quite early compared to other places, but the apartment is VERY cute and convenient, so it's still worth the stay.",10
10945,Apartments Breydelhof,"Cozy apartment, very well appointed in a perfect location (next to the Vismarkt. Bicycles provided too! Few stairs to the apartment. Bed upstairs in loft with relatively low ceiling; fine for us. Bathroom small (shower inclusive), but nice and worked great for us (and rain showerhead). Essentials provided (including for cooking if you want to do that). Super easy check in/out which also helped for our late-ish arrival time. Would definitely recommend and stay again.","Minor note that the Senseo coffee maker with provided pods makes fair ""American-style"" coffee, but it's awful by European standards. No problem, but Nespresso-style is much preferred, at least for us.",10

6003,Cap's House,The central location is great. Our host Camille was very quick to respond to any requests. Apartment is well heated and spacious. Great place to use as a base.,Was missing a few simple things. Iron and ironing board but Camille did organise one from the other apartment. Buy another one guys! Blind in the back room needs a bit of attention (strings are just tangled which is typical of those blinds so couldn't get it down) but wasn't a big deal.,8.8
5878,Cap's House,The apartment is in excellent location. Spacious and bright.,Communication was poor. For several weeks we did not get a confirmation as to which apartment we actually booked. This was irrespective of repeated messages and even a phone call. The answer came on the day of arrival. We had to ask for check-in instructions several times as well. Two towels were dirty. There was no soap by the sink in the bathroom so we used the shower gel from the shower. No kitchen towel. One bulb cover needs fixed in the bathroom and lots of empty nails on the walls. Despite that we found everything else we needed and had a good stay.,8

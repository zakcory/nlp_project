21944,Hotel Mirabeau,"The location is pretty good, really in the city center, close to many attractions. All the staffs are nice, polite and willing to offer help.","The room is old and the facilities are kind of broken. It's newly painted so the room is full of the bad smell of paint, which really made us uncomfortable. The most important, the hotel may not be clean. All of us got herpes on our body especially on feet, hands and arm. This really annoyed us.",6.3
22262,Hotel Mirabeau,Close to main attractions.,Very small room. Weird smell inside. You can hear all conversations from other rooms. Not very clean. Toilet was in vary bad condition. Broken hairdryer. Window just opposite the wall so the room was completly dark. Too hot in the room.,3.3
22875,Hotel Mirabeau,Location. Very close to downtown.,"I paid( pretty much!) a single room, including TV and the lighting-yes, no matter what strange it would be!!! The room was very dark, no bulbs in the ceiling, the only lighting source was the neon lights above the bed, which did not work! Just he next day, after my insistence, was brought into my room a small light, that shines discreetly just not to think you're in dark! Tv programs did not work in room( but at the hotel lobby they were running!). The staff told me either there are some working on streets around hotel area or is a plumber who deals the problem, but whom I've not seen!",3.8
22746,Hotel Mirabeau,The location was probably the only redeeming quality of this particular hotel. It was pretty easy to find and just a short walk to everything that you need.,"The room was filthy. The whole hotel was filthy to be honest apart from the reception area. Paint was peeling off the walls, the toilet in my room had not been cleaned or even flushed which was pretty disgusting, the bedding it's self I didn't even dare take the top cover off. The noise is the worst I've came across it sounds like someone is stamping up and down the hallway through the night. I think I slept fully clothed on top of the bed for about 2 hours and I think exhaustion is what allowed me that much sleep. I know this is a 2 star hotel but there is no way it should be given more than 1.",4.2
22179,Hotel Mirabeau,"A few minute walk to the Mannekin Pis and Grand Place, 10-15 minutes to Brussels Central and there are many restaurant options around the area. Clean room and functional toilet and bath. Breakfast was okay for the 5 euro extra.","Wifi, TV, and heating were all not working inside my room in the 4th floor. No telephone or intercom. You have to take the lift back and forth just to ask something at the reception (e.g. Wifi password, breakfast time, etc. - as they don't proactively give you this information). Reception staff could be better. ",8.3
21709,Hotel Mirabeau,The property is centrally located.,"The property is only good for 1 night's sleep for long periods I do not recommend
We knew for this price we couldn't expect more, but it should still be cleaner",7.1
21935,Hotel Mirabeau,The ubication is nice . It is close from the center but  the room was cold . This was a litle uncomfortable yo have a shower for exemplo.,The room was cold.,7.5

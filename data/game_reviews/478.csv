2273,For Four Flat,"It is a beautiful, very clean apartment, the land lady is very, very nice, she left us a bottle of rose wine as a wellcome drink, it was a nice gesture. The kitchen is basically new, perfectly equipped. She explained us everything, every information she gave us even before by mail was absolutely correct. We had a very good time there.","If I have to say something, maybe some air condition could help if the weather is extremely hot, so we do not need to open the windows, when there is a lot of noise coming from the streets. And a little freezer also would be nice. But these are not really important, we had a wonderful stay there.",9.6
2303,For Four Flat,Excellent communication from the owner. All the things in the flat worked. The fixtures and fittings were of generally high standard. Very spatious and nicely furnished. Keypad instead of keys makes it easy to split up a group and not worry about getting back in.,"Not a problem in colder days but the lack of freezer might have been annoying in the summer if one wants ice and icecream. As we were travelling as a couple a sofa rather than just armchairs would have been nice, although they were comfortable. These are minor points though as we were out most of the time and the neighbourhood is well stocked with cafes and eateries.",9
2151,For Four Flat,"Carine's place was lovely and homey, fully equipped to make you own meals, very stylish and comfortable.","So many stairs to get to room, a little difficult with luggage!",10

2164,For Four Flat,"For Four Flats was perfect for our needs - plenty of room and nicely appointed.  Great location - close to tram stop, shopping, restaurants and a short walk to the city center.  Communication with owner was excellent from booking through checkout.  Would definitely recommend.",,10
2209,For Four Flat,"Central location, clean, well appointed. Loved the Honesty Bar, where items like beer, nespresso pods and wine were in the flat and we could leave money to reimburse her. She answered all of my emails promptly. Overall, a great choice!","The only problem was that every night, from midnight until 2 or 3 AM, many rowdy people would migrate from bar to home. We stayed there 7 nights and it never failed to wake us all up, usually multiple times per night. It was better when we shut the windows, which cut down on a lot of the noise, but it was too hot for us to do that. ",10

15395,Hotel Monasterium PoortAckere,"I imagine staying at the monasterium is great, but I wouldn't know. It looked really nice.","Why I chose this hotel (and pay a higher rate) was because of the experience of staying in an old monasterium. Our room was in a newly built building in the parking lot next to the street, not in the Monasterium. Even though it was a quiet street, if a car drove by you could hear it and wake you up. Imagine paying to stay at a castle and then that your room is in the shed next to it. The receptionist was zero helpful and zero friendly, it was a really bad experience. All the pictures show the old rooms and the Monasterium, which is what I paid for and at the end we arrived to something completely different.",1

15700,Hotel Monasterium PoortAckere,"By the sound of the other reviews I think we received one of their newly refurbished rooms. The room was very modern, updated and clean. It came with a coffee machine and little fridge as well. We loved the breakfast as well and having tea throughout the day. The hotel was very beautiful and historic! ",The breakfast is a little too expensive to be worth it every morning.,10

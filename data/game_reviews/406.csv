17842,Csar Private Guesthouse,"Highly recommend this wonderful little gem. Perfectly located, quiet street and was stocked with more staples than any other place we've stayed ( ie: coffee, tea, cereal, clear and accessible information). My 7 year old daughter was thrilled and feeling like a princess in her own attic bedroom..
The only note is that it is NOT for anyone without high mobility as the first staircase is extremely steep and the second staircase is more like a ladder.. and all beds are upstairs. There is, however, a comfortable couch on the main floor. We would certainly stay here again if/when we return to fairytale Bruges.

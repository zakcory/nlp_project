Very simple but good breakfast(5$pp)
The water in the shower is very hot(nice when you want take shower after a long walk)
Friendly staff and really helpfull
Price/quality","The heatingsystem didn't work in the bathroom.it was freezing there.
When you take shower, the doors don't close good with as result the water go slowly to the rest of the bathroom and even the bedroom.
And there are works going on outside to make a new street,the workers start @6:00u in the morning, but the hotel can not help it.

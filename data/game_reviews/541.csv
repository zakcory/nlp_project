13871,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel",There was airconditioning in the room  And everything else was great! Will book again in the future!,The timing for the breakfast. if you where 30min late Is was a big issue for the staff..,8
13954,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel","The hotel is in the centre of Hasselt, walking distance to the nice area of restaurants and bars, Hasselt has a great atmosphere. The hotel is good and a nice place to stay for the night.","The parking costs $ 19, but if you drive to the streets in the area, you should be able to find a spot, at least in my case it was quite easy. Just bear in mind that you need to either leave before 9 or pay in the machine the charge for the next morning, until the time you stay, otherwise you could be fined.",9.6

13754,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel",Breakfast was very good! The location of the hotel is near the parking which is comfortable. Easy to get to the center of the city. The room was clean and looked great. Staff is terrific.,Can't remember any problem there.,10
13543,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel","Staff super friendly and helpful. Modern feel in the lobby & eating area. bed was quite comfortable but found the room pretty basic. There was small sitting area and tv with limited channels. Continental breakfast was included and contrary to other hotels, you could still had good selection later in the day!",getting to the parking was really a hassle. Although it was just steps away from the hotel we had to take the small ring and do a full 360 to get to in. There are 2 entrances and the one in front of the Holiday Inn is super tight fit. We had to inch our way in. And be careful there are 2 holiday inns in the same area : holiday inn and holiday inn express.,7
13907,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel",,Sofa bed was not made up on arrival (although the lovely receptionist solved this quickly for us) and that bed was very uncomfortable. Kept banging legs on the metal outer structure which was above the height of the thin mattress. Not what I would expect for ¬£130/night.,7.5
13594,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel","We booked for the Holiday Inn Express. Due to Corona, this hotel is closed and the reservation is changed to the Holiday Inn a few meters further down the road. The Holiday Inn normally is much more expensive, so that was a great upgrade.",Due to Corona we were obliged to have breakfast at exactly 11h00. The only other option was to get a breakfast kit and eat it somewhere else. This is totally unexceptable when you have a whole day planned ahead of you and hope to have a good breakfast at the hotel!,7

21123,Hotel Bitgenbacher Hof,"Clean, professional, modern yet with character, efficient staff, well kept property, food excellent, staff friendly. Bed confortable, the pool was a great surprise. Kids friendly. Nice playground just opposite the hotel. Our room was on the small side but fit an extra bed for a child. It was all very cosy. Bedroom well arranged. ","Our bedroom faced the car park, on first floor just above the entrance so it was a little noisy in the evening with guests standing outside or smoking outside. Smoking should not be allowed so near the entrance of the hotel. 
Summer can get hot so air conditioning would be a plus. ",9

Also monday and tuesday the restuarant is closed, one of the reasons I go to that hotel. pitty.",7

13918,Dansaert Hotel,"Rooms were good, location was perfect. Location is great since I was very close to everything of interest. Staff are extremely helpful and helped with all my queries.",Single room doesn't have a safe and beneath the bed in my room was extremely dusty. Noise from the road at night makes it very difficult to sleep. Beds aren't comfortable.,7.1
14601,Dansaert Hotel,The location was close to most sites. Very close to McDonalds which was good for a quick breakfast.,We arrived at a time when they were totally renovating the lobby. They were painting the walls and the floor was down to the cement. Would not have stayed here if I had known. Though the rooms were not effected it still felt uncomfortable with having no sitting area and feeling like you are in a middle of a construction site instead of a relaxing holiday. Would have appreciated knowing this.,5

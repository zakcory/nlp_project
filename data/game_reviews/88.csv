7454,Apartment Jules & Jim,"At arrival you have to call a gsm-number.  A friendly lady gives you the key-code of the house, the same of your apartment. There are 4 apartments: 1 on the ground floor, 2 on the 1st floor with terrace on the back and 1 on top (the largest without terrace). The proprietor is an art-gallery owner who's gallery is located next door. This house is designed in style with old furniture.","No view of the riverboards (if terrace, at the back). The bed is really hard, not recommended for back sufferers! Stairs to do when you're not located on the ground floor.",8

7563,Apartment Jules & Jim,"For future visitors - the location and value for money is great.  VERY IMPORTANT: contact the host by phone about half an hour before your arrival, because there's no reception desk or anything of the like. A basic knowledge of French will also be helpful. Enjoy!",,10
7628,Apartment Jules & Jim,The location was good.,"The host ! I called beforehand to say I was going to arrive there late, after calling 4 times someone finally picked up. When I arrived at the property I couldn't get in. Was not told the door code. Was not told what room I was in. Called many times. No-one answered. I spent 1 hour in the hallway trying to get in. Eventually other guests saw me and said they had the same problem so randomly took a room. 2 hours after I'd arrived, the owner finally got in touch.  His answer was ''oh well at least you didn't wait too long, I was having dinner with friends, this is not a hotel'', this was at almost 10pm, I had a race the next day, with an early start. So very, very rude.",8.3
7665,Apartment Jules & Jim,"The sunroof, the spacious apartment, the very central location of the apartment, the cleanliness. ","The lack of good WiFi signal throughout the entire apartment. The water pressure in the bathroom was low, the late check in time. ",7.9
7669,Apartment Jules & Jim,"The apartment was spacious, beautifully decorated with kitchen facilities and room to relax. The outside area was just lovely. So central to everrythig and so quiet. The perfect place to discover Dinant. ",,10
7518,Apartment Jules & Jim,Located right in the middle of Dinant. We walked everywhere. Easy check-in and parking nearby.,"Tap in the bathroom didn't quite work well. Shower was nice, but needed to be held in hand. Used the bathtub instead :)",8

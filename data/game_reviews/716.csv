4998,Hotel Du Parlement,"position, size of room","- noise, until 1 pm, from a nearby disco - mosquito, due to the owners having left the windows opened in the evening - it's modest, but that's ok for the price category in that area (considering the discount, without the discount it I would have found a better deal in another part of the city)",6.3
4894,Hotel Du Parlement,"Location - close to the EU Parliament.
The room was big (I had one at the penthouse) and the bed comfortable. ","Difficult to carry a bag up and down the stairs. The steps are too small, some of them quite shabby.
The staircase looks unkempt. 
The reception and breakfast bar were not open at 7.30 in the morning. I had to eat breakfast in another hotel.

Good for short-term stay if you do not stay in the hotel lot of the time. Very friendly staff.","I used to stay at cheaper hotels in higher quality and with better facilities. Okay, nothing against simplicity and a bit old-fashioned equipment, but in this case.I pay just for the location?

3508,Hotel Boterhuis,"Great location, really big family room, really good breakfast, pleasant and very helpful staff","Everything was great, we just had some difficulty in navigating the spiral staircase to our 2nd floor room as we had heavy luggage. We managed fine. ",10
3169,Hotel Boterhuis,"The breakfast was simple but good. They have this sort of underground, cave-like area which works as a second breakfast room, pretty amazing! It's very close to the old town center. Quite a few things to see at walking distance from the hotel. The hotel itself was in this quirky old building, which was pretty interesting.","The stairs were small and we ended up using a spiral stairway to carry our bags up, which was a little difficult. The bathroom didn't seem to have any ventilation. There was a little side street near our balcony where you'd have people stopping to chat out loud and sometimes school children, you could also hear cars with the windows open. Not a huge deal though.",7.9
2796,Hotel Boterhuis,"The hotel was a great choice for a city trip to Bruges, located in a charming old building few minutes walking from the main market square. The ladies running the place were very kind and helpful and we had a very good breakfast, even if it was served in the room due to the pandemic.. The room we had was clean and large with comfortable beds. We also used the private parking few steps away from the hotel but that was not a problem. We definitely recommend this place and we will not hesitate coming back at some point :-)","There weren't really negative points, maybe just a visual embarrassment brought by the works around the hotel, they were killing a bit the charm of the surroundings but that is something you cannot avoid :-)",8
2892,Hotel Boterhuis,"Friendly and helpful staff, the breakfast was very good (bread, cheeses, meat, eggs, cereal, etc) 
It a very nice location. The parking is easily accessible and all the major highlights are within walking distance. 
Be sure to reserve parking space in advance as it is limited. ",,10

2708,Hotel Boterhuis,We had a private courtyard and a small atrium we could eat our breakfast in.  It was very cozy.  Breakfast was also delicious.  Everyone at the front desk is welcoming and friendly.  It feels like you're visiting a friend's house.  The shower was also great. Public parking is right around the corner and easy to get to.,,9

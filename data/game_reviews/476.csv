9478,Floreal Nieuwpoort,Location is good,"Breakfast very limited. Some time you need to wait elevators. Room cleaned one time in 2-3 days despite that we cooked in room. Garbage bin was sometimes full. We was forced to buy toilet paper, soap and shampoo.",7
9495,Floreal Nieuwpoort,"The hotel room was excellent, in terms of being able to 'look after yourself'.  It had a kitchen with everything you needed, including plates, cups and cutlery.  Staff were friendly and we got free parking on the grounds. The beds fold up into the wardrobe to make room during the day.  My partner and I slept really well.   The breakfast was fine.  Continental buffet.  Only there one night, so didn't use any of the other facilities.","The view from the room is of the town.  Would have preferred a sea view, but I don't think any of the rooms have that.  There is a ferocious wind that comes off of the sea.  Maybe that is why.  I thought the check in time was a bit late at 4.30pm and the check out time a bit early 10am.",9.2
9516,Floreal Nieuwpoort,The location is decent..not great.,"It is getting run down.  The hotel rooms all face a gas station and the city.  The other side of the building, where there are no rooms, face the ocean.  Don't be fooled when you reserve a room with a view.  THERE ARE NO ROOMS WITH AN OCEAN VIEW!",5.4
9545,Floreal Nieuwpoort,Pool but not the changing room (small cabins),"First room we checked in was smoking room, as read  in previous comments. Me moved room and baby cot ourselves, no staff or lazy. Check out at 10am, swimming pool opens at 10 am. So second day you cannot use it. Strategic but no nice. Bistrot/restaurant so and so  Breakfast is average or below but included in the price",5.4

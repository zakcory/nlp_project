24471,B&B Hildegarden,"We booked this B&B for the festival Antilliaanse feesten. This location was a full halfhour drive to the festival back and forth. So one might want to overthink this distance to the festival for 3 days. Bit overall a fantastic place to stay. Rooms were superclean, the staff overly friendly and very helpful. The view from the room was a bit poor due to the fact that we overlooked gardens of residences next door.",The view from the room overlooking gardens of children playing and no privacy when door was open.,9.2

24586,B&B Hildegarden,"Beautifully appointed B&B with friendly owners. There was a problem with the WiFi (which had been excellent) and the owners imediately acted.
I used it as a base to go to Tournhout, Vorselaar, Geel and Mechelen, all of which were in easy driving distance.
Highly recommended.",,9.6

25541,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,It is close to the Central station and we could walk to quite a lot of attractions and did not have to make use of public transport.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.,"I hated the twin beds.  Not the fact that they were separate, but the fact that the mattresses are so light, and with every turn it would move, which meant you spent mos of the night trying to keep the mattress on the base.  The mattress was  also stained and it just did not seem that clean to me.",4
26032,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"This was  the nastiest hotel I have seen anywhere and for bookings.com to advertise it is pathetic.do you not ever research the properties you advertise on your site? We had four rooms booked for 8 total people and we everyone arrived, two of the rooms were so deplorable our friends went next door to the Hampton Inn, we kept two rooms but the hotel had the audacity to charge us for all rooms anyway, to which I will dispute with my card company. I plan on never using booking.com to book rooms as the standards are less than adequate, to say the least!",A completely different hotel!,3.8
25703,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,Nothing,Beds were not made and the room was filthy. The maid wanted to argue with us that sheets were clean even though there was hair on them. Disgusting room.,3.8
26165,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"Good location, big beds. ",Room wasn't clean when we arrived (rice left of the table and marks in the bathroom. ),5
25681,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,Location,"Staff and service! 
After 01 am they put the light of and they close the doer, you have to call via the bell and wait in that could till they open the doer!
There must be another way to get in without calling staff! 
And the next doer in the middle of the night they were making noises, I also enjoy the weekend, but I feel and respect around me!

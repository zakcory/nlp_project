2033,Van Der Valk Hotel Brugge Oostkamp,The reception refurbishment work is good but I think the hotel has lost its cosy appeal.,"The reception staff were cold, and it felt like we were not welcome, the room service was very expensive, cold and poor quality. 
The rooms are looking tired and the wall paper is beginning to peel in places.",5.4
1421,Van Der Valk Hotel Brugge Oostkamp,"We love the location of this hotel, about one 1 1/4 hours from the channel tunnel and just off the E40 for heading South into central Europe. The rooms are hyge, the bathrooms are huge and have great facilities.",Nothing.,9
1489,Van Der Valk Hotel Brugge Oostkamp,"Amazing hotel.  We had a 1 night stay on route to our next location.  It is conveniently located, parking was free and easy.  The reception area was beautifully decorated, as was the room and the restaurant.  We ate in the restaurant, the food was delicious and good value.  The room was large with a balcony and had everything we needed for our stay.  We would definitely stay here again.",,10
2004,Van Der Valk Hotel Brugge Oostkamp,Location of room on ground floor near where my motorcycle was parked giving easy access for loading.,Price of whiskey in bar,7.1
1931,Van Der Valk Hotel Brugge Oostkamp,Anything nice was clouded by very poor handling of charges.,"We got a room for a really good price for what was stated clearly as 2 adults and 1 child (both in the Booking website and in the email confirmation).
When we arrived at around 8 pm, reception staff told me we had to pay an extra $25 for my son's bed.
When I complained and showed the email confirmation, I was pointed to wording all the way down in the email  saying that ""charges may apply"".  When I complained again and told reception wording should be made a lot clear, they shrugged it off and didn't even blink to charge me.
Very deceiving and really poor custome experience from the staff at reception.
Not going back.",4
1841,Van Der Valk Hotel Brugge Oostkamp,"Location was easy to find, beautifully situated and the grounds, room, facilities was really great to experience, the room was spacious and comfortable. The breakfast was extra but well worth the money spent. The extra touches like tea, coffee, water, beer and cool drinks for free was exceptional.","It displayed in our welcome book that we were able to purchase drinks from a vending machine but when we went to go find it, it was no longer available at the hotel to guests, we had to go to the bar to purchase anything further, which for us at the time was not what we wanted to do, we would have really enjoyed a night in the room by ourselves.",9.6
1524,Van Der Valk Hotel Brugge Oostkamp,"I am a frequent visitor of this Hotel and I have never been disappointed. Ideal location, very clean and supported by helpful and very efficient staff. I have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel.",All aspects of this Hotel are of a good standard and I therefore have no complaints.,8

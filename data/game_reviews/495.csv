12308,Grand Hotel de Flandre,"Fantastic staff around 24/7, so helpful and friendly! Great, convenient location close to everything but quiet and peaceful, super clean and secure hotel, great water pressure, great functioning A/C, and they welcomed our dog. Liked the convenient drinks available in lobby. Parking easy. Will stay here again!","Immediate vicinity is a bit sketch across from train station but don't be put off or worried by that, just walk around the corner to the pedestrian district.",10
12419,Grand Hotel de Flandre,I liked the luxurious aspect of the hotel coming from the entrance to the reception. And I equally enjoyed the modern feel of the room which is well equipped. The bed was comfortable and the air condition was so much appreciated on that warm day!,The only thing that bothered me was that it felt very warm in the gangway between the lift and the room. The price for the breakfast (which I didn't take) seems fairly expensive (about 20$ if I remember correctly).,10

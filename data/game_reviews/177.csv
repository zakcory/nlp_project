7554,B&B Bariseele,"Had a wonderful stay, room was a really good size with everything we needed while the neighbourhood was very quiet. Our host Benny was very attentive and put on a really good breakfast every morning with lots of locally sourced produce and even bespoke waffles and pancakes :) He answered all our questions and set us up well for the day whatever plans we had, which was much appreciated. Highly recommended.","Having to leave, both the Bariseele and Bruges..",10

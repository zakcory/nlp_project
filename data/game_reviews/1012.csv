11134,Theater Hotel,Helpful staff when I wanted to add late checkout to the booking.,"The room was a little aged. All of the electrical fittings were yellowed from age, gave the place a bit of a cheap feel.. plus a loud hum from the electrical source when the halogen lights were on.",7.5
11517,Theater Hotel,"Comfortable room, great location, and a low price. People were very friendly.","Breakfast was basic, and could have a bit more variety. Elevator doors close extremely fast.",7.9
10901,Theater Hotel,Location is excellent. The room is very clean.,"It was strange, ticking sound in radiator an evening. Shower was difficult to get working. There is no carpet and they do not give slippers and bathrobe. I advise to take your own slippers if you do not want to walk on the floor by barefoot after shower.
The design of room is bit ""clinical"" but in general it was not disturbing for staying during weekend. ",7
10921,Theater Hotel,The breakfast far surpassed expectations with Covid restrictions. Room was large and spacious.,,9
11425,Theater Hotel,"Liked the firm bed, kettle was provided, mugs, wine glasses, fridge. Enjoyed access to the roof top balcony from my room (6th floor). The on-site restaurant serves delicious food (I was there for dinner).  It was great to have 2 types of eggs for breakfast and a variety of cold cuts and cheeses.","I didn't find it too bad, but my room was next to the elevator shaft which made noise at every hour day and night - that particular room location could be a problem for sensitive sleepers.",9.6
11248,Theater Hotel,"Very spacious room. Ours even had a balcony which was quite large and offered some good views. Friendly staff. While they don't have onsite parking, the public garage is very, close by. Reasonable breakfast.","Very, very dark room when first coming in at night. It took us a minute for our eyes to adjust so we could find where the other lamps were. We ended up leaving a light on while gone. Breakfast was a bit of a zoo. While we didn't have to wait, there was a line a dozen people deep when we left.",8.8
11544,Theater Hotel,Great location and friendly staff. Unfortunately doesnt make up for lying awake every night!,"This was the most unconfortable bed i have ever had. The matress was so old and worn out, the springs were sticking in your back at night. 
Also lots of noise. The walls are very thin and you can hear your neighbors talking, walking and making noises. Couldnt wait for our stay to be over.",5.8

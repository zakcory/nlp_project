9607,B&B Den Engel,"Extraordinary location!!
A recommendation from us for all who wants to have a stay near Brussels.
You should book incl. breakfast as this was so great. Rooms are clean and decorated with love and pleasure.
The train from Kortenberg takes only 28 minutes to the center of Brussels.
We booked just for one night to stop before travelling further.
Joris and his wife were so kind and did everything for us to feel comfortable.
Thanks a lot.

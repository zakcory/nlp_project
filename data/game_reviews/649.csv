3809,Hotel Boterhuis,"Location is perfect! Very close to the Market square, the main place of the city. The breakfast is delicious, one of the best croissant I have ever had. The staff is very kindly too!","There is no lift, so you need to carry the luggage via stairs. But this was a very small thing compared to the other good features of the hotel.",9.6

4624,Hotel Boterhuis,Location was absolutely fantastic.  Breakfast was quite fine without being outstanding.  Lovely staying in a building with character and history.    The hosts were very helpful with recommendations for dinner.  Loved Poules et Moules!,"We were in a room up 2 flights of stairs so a bit difficult with 2 suitcases weighing 18 kg each!  Perhaps you might put those traveling from afar eg Australia on lower levels?  Many travelling from a distance come to Europe for a few weeks, so have more luggage.  Next time we will request a room on a lower floor.  But we enjoyed our stay and loved your town.",7.9
3176,Hotel Boterhuis,"The Breakfast was very good and nicely presented. The location is excellent,5 minutes from The Belltower. I wouldn't think the hotel is suitable for anybody with any mobility problems as we had some very steep stairs to get to our room.They probably have some ground floor rooms though.",I couldn't find anything wrong with The Boterhuis and we will probably stay again.,7.9

4225,Hotel Boterhuis,"The location was excellent, walkable to everything we wanted to see. The room was spacious and comfortable, we had the room right on the street but still felt like it was private and quiet at night. The breakfast spread was excellent too, so nice to have eggs made fresh for us every morning in addition to the meats, cheeses, and croissants. Would highly recommend this hotel.",,10

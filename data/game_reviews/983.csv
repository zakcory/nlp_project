The apartment was fully equipped and clean. The location is in the city centre, close to many shopping and dining places. The metro stop is just a few minutes away on foot.",Some furniture is a bit worn out and the bathroom need proper door (instead of the curtain).,9
14244,Smartflats Design - Monnaie,"Hassle-free self check-in with a code, no need to make arrangements and time your arrival or stress when delayed. Downtown location, very central to shops, bars and restaurants. Very spacious and clean. Very good heating and great water pressure which helps to shower the cold away.","Quite a lot of noise from the busy street and upstairs neighbour moving around. The sofa bed wasn't comfortable to sit on, there could be more and more comfortable seating. Some fixtures and lamps in the bathroom were broken, little storage in the bedroom and bathroom. Stingy with the paper-thin pillows and duvet, would be good to have an extra one.",7.9

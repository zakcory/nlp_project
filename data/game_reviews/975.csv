22359,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,easy and safe access ; description to enter was good. Location in the center and garage parking within 100m was perfect.  The beds were all Cocomat brand with different hardness - perfect to try.  Building first floor is a good hamburger place and we were hungry - super in Corona times.,"The master bedroom window was at at inner air duct and the vents were quite noisy. The chair in the dining/kitchen were really old, used and torn. The appartement was not updated for a few years, but was clean.",7
22535,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,"Huge apartment, very near the central station.","The common areas of the building are filthy. They bring all the trash bags in the elevators and leave the liquids that sip out and food left overs all over the floor and walls (I have pictures to prove it), the smell is like body decomposition.. I have never felt this nauseated over a smell in my life. We just had to use the stairs all the way to the 5th floor. the cleaning ladies use our apartment (501) as a storage (they never cleaned it, which we knew) so you have zero privacy in the common areas.",7.1
22733,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,It was spacious,There were a few things broken,7
22480,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,Beautiful appartment. High ceiling. Huge bed.,"To get into the building you have to enter a code, which not always working, even if it's correct. It's always smells bad on the first floor and in elevator. The appartment itself are nice, but there are a couple of problems. Firstly, the heating system is really strange, so mostly it was cold inside. Secondly, there is no modem in that appartment (I'm talking about penthouse), probably another appartment on the 6th floor has it. It means that you can catch a signal in the kitchen only. And it's really slow, 6MB/s. Finally, no one tell us that there is a huge construction 5 meters from this building. So it was extremely loud from 6:40am till evening. It will be there for next 4-5 month I guess. ",7.1
22600,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,Location fantastic easy to get to,Weather so hot no aircon which isn't a problem but think fans could have been supplied knowing how the weather was,6.7
22838,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,"Nothing, then issues we had make the experience very awful ","The next building in front of the apartment it was very noisy from 6am until 17h. Smartflats already knew it in advance and did not communicated to us . Very bad management from them. 
A part of that, the apartment had low maintenance and we had issues with the shower, lights fussed, dishwasher did not work, windows broken..

22566,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,Great location and very spacious apartment. Checkin via the codes was smooth.,"The window insulation has its limitations. The bedroom at the streetside was quite noisy (we were at the fourth floor). The bedroom at the 'interior' was very quiet.
Some parts of the accomodation are a bit run down. Our room e.g. had no functioning curtains, and some appliances miss a button or two (but still worked).
Overall, I can recommend this place.",8.3

18689,Hotel Koffieboontje,"The bed was comfortable.  The breakfast was standard.  The location was great, and really close to everything!","The rooms were out dated.  The toilet was separate from the washing facilities so you had to walk through the entire apartment to wash your hands. This might be standard for the area, so this may be a moot point.   Our hair dryer was broken and when I asked to have it fixed they told me to go to the lobby to borrow one they had at the front desk.  No one bothered to fix it.  The lobby was locked at breakfast time and I didn't have my key before I was to leave for work (left it in my room for my family).  Would've been nice to be informed of this upon check in.",5.8
16649,Hotel Koffieboontje,"We loved the location, room and option to have breakfast. The staff was really friendly and spoke English to assist my friend who doesn't speak Dutch. The room was clean and the terrace is a great area to enjoy some fresh air.",,9

19037,Hotel Koffieboontje,Breakfast and Location,"1. The ""extremely"" soft bed 2. The answer from the staff to my question on the  small list of television channels. I asked if it would be possible to help my old father in his room to see another channel. The proposal from the staff: ""please use a tablet or mobile instead"". How could my father possibly use a tablet or mobile?? 3. The sewage smell in the corridor 4. We asked for a small extension for the checkout time. The regular checkout time was 12:00. We thought the staff member allowed us to extend it to twelve fifty (12:50). Obviously, at 12:50 we understood the staff member kindly accorded us an extension of only 15 (fifteen) minutes. Very generous, considering the room price of 200 Euro/night",5.8

16844,Hotel Koffieboontje,"After I checked in, I saw two bed bugs in the bed. I told the staff and they changed the room for me. It was good that they immediately deal with the situation. The next day, the staff told me they have contacted the company to deal with the bed begs.","The first room I stayed, there were two bed bugs in the bed.",7

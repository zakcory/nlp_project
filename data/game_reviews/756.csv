18472,Hotel Koffieboontje,"The location was excellent, mostly the hotel was lovely and quiet. Most staff were welcoming.","Our room was not cleaned one day, one room was very loud in the night and when I mentioned this to staff they contradicted me so that was a bit embarrassing.",5.8
18288,Hotel Koffieboontje,Absolutely nothing,We are experienced travelers on motorcycles and have stayed in hundreds of hotels all over Europe this past 30years some not so good but mostly all are good. But this place was deceiving at first sight and at reception all looked good. But that's where it ended. The hall way to the lift was filthy the lift was just as bad and the narrow corridor to the room was littered with cleaners trolleys which we thought was a good thing haha no such luck. The room it's self must have been there since Noah's ark and maintained by Bob the builder. Oh and to get to the breakfast area was a challenge get lift to lower floor negotiate a twisty corridor then get another lift to acces the dining area.  Now there's another story for another day.,5
17693,Hotel Koffieboontje,"The most important thing: it was clean. The room, the bed, the toilet and bathroom;
24h reception; very friendly;
The location is unbeatable! ",The Beds were uncomfortable and very short; there was a breakfast but without vegetables or fruits - think they could level up their breakfast (especially during Christmas where the prices are higher in general),7.9
17814,Hotel Koffieboontje,"The location was excellent, very close to the market, next to the belfort. It is a budget hotel, so it's a little bit basic, but it had everything I needed. Small kitchen, a bath and a nice bed! When I first came in, the room was very clean. The staff was very friendly, I came to check in, and I was offered a room with a kitchen, as my original one didn't have one.","The small tv was a nice addition, only few channels, and often bad signal. Other than that, I can't say anything bad. Met the expectations of a budget holiday, basic, but you get everything you need!",10
17786,Hotel Koffieboontje,The location is incredible. The closest you can get to the hot spots in Bruges.,"I didn't like that the booking.com site claimed there was a big last minute discount, while in the end it was simply the regular rate for a very mediocre room. There was some dishonesty here.",6.7
17853,Hotel Koffieboontje,"Excellent location. Great value for money. The man at the reception was very friendly, informative and helpful.10/10",,10
17915,Hotel Koffieboontje,"The room was clean, wifi was strong, bed was comfortable and I didnt hear much of the outside world even with window open. Its slightly off main tourism so it helped ","Not much to say, the accommodations were great",10

22697,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,The apartment location is excellent.  Love the washing machine and dryer.  It really helps!!,"There is no air conditioning so we have to open the window but then there are lots of mosquitos so that was not very pleasant as we have to get up all night to try to kill them.  So maybe window screen to avoid bugs coming in?! Other then that, everything is perfect!",9.2
22667,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,Big and beautiful room with amazing balcony and view.,"No ventilation except with windows or doors wide open. If open, sound was deafening and mosquitoes were intense. The smell coming from the bathroom drains was disgusting - there were no additional towels, toilet paper or other amenities provided for a 4 nite stay. Entrance and lifts looked to be last cleaned in the 80s.",4.6
22582,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,The apartment was large and spacious,"Smell of septic from drains, some furniture stained or dirty, no mattress cover in one bedroom, dvd player not working and not fixed during stay, request for parking and baby cot not addressed until I called 3 days before stay and then they weren't able to accommodate cot request and loud construction opposite flat which will continue for some time",5.8
22341,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,,The smell in the entry way /lift. The unit needed a bit mote of a homely fell. It reminds me of staying in a hostel again.,6
22377,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,,"the apartment is very spacious and clean only with the detail that they claim to be two rooms and it is only one. Also counting not being able to enjoy the internet on the upper floor, thanking the attention given, I am still pleasantly pleased with its facilities ",6
22780,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,The actual room looked nice. Not the cleanest but its nice to be in the middle of the city.,"It seems like a good value, but once you actually arrive and see the trash next to the elevator, the dirty building, broken entry door (every one has access to the building).. You start reconsidering paying $240 for 2 nights + $300 waranty for whats basically a 2 room motel. ",4
22590,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,"The flat is great. original and fun. It's big, clean and in position A. We loved Antwrep and despite the fire alarm going off in the building on our first morning,which kind of ruined the day for my already tired elderly partner we shopped and cooked and walked. Loved the baroque and the modern.",You're wrong not to provide salt pepper and oil. It would cost nothing.It's a very lovely kitchen for cooks.Lids for pans would be good too..If you'd prefer us not to cook why put in such a great kitchen? Why not allow people to use the washing machine by providing a tablet or two. Tell people that the shop on the ground floor is big and red and called 5 Guys and the door to smartflats is right there!We're in a new city and need big signs.,7.5

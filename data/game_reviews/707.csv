25481,Hotel du Commerce,"Charming hotel located in the middle of the lovely town Houffalize. Very nice Christmas decorations and lights. A lot of walks and ATB routes. Nice food, served in our room because of corona. We even had a jacuzzi in our spacious bathroom.","The shower head was broken, but in the end the manager himself came to fix it. The ""art"" on the walls was pretty seedy and outdated to be honest, please put some new paintings up!",8

25494,Hotel du Commerce,"Service is excellent, rooms very clean, inside of the hotel is more then beautiful, VERY rich breakfast.",There were some small torn on towels and sheets.,9
25404,Hotel du Commerce,The room was very well: spacious and clean. Breakfast was very good.,No possibility to have dinner in the garden because there was no staff available even it was promised before and the hotel was almost fully booked. Even for take-away dinner the garden could not be used. Take-away pizza was not baked very well and it was not cut into slices. Very little space for the bikes in the laundry room. Both days of our stay we needed to reinstall ourselves the laundry racks and trays to create place.,7
25468,Hotel du Commerce,"The room was spacious, bathtub was good too. Breakfast has generous portions. ","We went for the package room + dinner and we found that it was very pricey for what it was. The meal was very basic cantine-like food (smoked salmon and salad as first course, pasta and chicken for the main course and a chocolate dessert). The room was nothing close to premium.. There was no boiler or tea/coffee facility. 
The parking space is also very limited. ",7

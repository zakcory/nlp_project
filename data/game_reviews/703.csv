3387,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,We have been staying at Dolce La Hulpe on a regular basis. Great hotel in a beautiful area. Large free parking space.,"Pity that due to Covid, the bar at reception and sauna were closed. But this is understandable.",9
3481,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,The environment is beautifull in the middle of woods. Great place for walking.,"There was some miscommunication, but probably due to the corona time we are still in.  The second morning we would have expected our breakfast to be delivered same moment as first day, but nothing happened. Eventually they told us that everyday we had to order it at the reception. Nobody informed us of this.",8
3712,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,"Nothing! Room was dirty and had an attack from bedbugs.
They didn't do any efforts towards me, housekeeping checked the room for bedbugs and couldn't find them? Ridiculous if you know that you can't see those bugs and need to call a specialist to treat it with chemicals.
No refunds or suggestions.
Food poisoning from what, i don't know cause I've ordered a lot.
Really a shame! 
My daughter had to sleep on the sofa cause they refused to unfold the sofa into a bed. But I've paid for a 2 bed room. 
Waist of money! ",Everything,1
3488,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,"This is a covid time review, so not representative of the usual service, I guess. But overall the stay was lovely, the room was comfortable, the staff were friendly, and the swimming pool was very nice. Can't wait to go back when things are returned to some normality to enjoy the restaurant and all other things that were closed because of covid. ","Covid Time room service menu is .. drab. But that's excusable, and we simply ordered sushi from outside which was lovely. ",9
3570,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,"Free bike rentals were really nice. Rooms were nice and cosy, but could do with a refresh. Breakfast was limited due to COVID. The area is really nice for outdoor activities.",Breakfast was added at check-out even though it was part of the booking. We had to go back to reception to get this corrected. Rooms felt a little outdated with wall to wall carpet (we prefer wooden floors).,8

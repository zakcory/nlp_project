21447,Baelskaai Harbor Apartment,"The spacious room was all renovated and very clean. Kitchen equipped with all almost the stuff you need (except an oven). Host was very communicative and helpful. He even assisted me showing in a map all activities I could do and also advised on some ""hidden"" information, like places for a cheap eating, historic places which are good or not to visit, etc. View from window was acceptable, looking from the side Port sea. Perfect heating system. Clean bathroom. Location was 4-5 km walk from the city or several minutes by tram.",,9.6
21461,Baelskaai Harbor Apartment,"This location is on the new side of Ostend on the docks. You can reach the town by car. A tip, do not drive into town but use the Railway station parking at 1,5 euro per hour. It is brand new, easily accessible and avoids the drive into town. Alternatively take the boat across. The apartment is brand new, design, parking in front of the door (free). The extra bonus is that this lets you discover the dunes (Fort Napoleon), quiet extensive beach and pure nature of Bredene. At the end of the beach promenade on which you can cycle (free use of 2 bicycles) there is a surfers bar for food and drink. For kids, below the Fort Napoleon, there is a huge playground in the sand, the biggest I have ever seen.",,10
21368,Baelskaai Harbor Apartment,"Beautifully furnished, warm and spotlessly clean.   In the peaceful fishing harbour - the other end of which is being developed with several blocks of luxury apartments and a couple of swish restaurants.  About 15 minutes' walk to the (free) shuttle boat going to the Ostend side of the harbour and about 20 minutes' walk to a long, beautiful and empty beach (Bredene).  Supermarkets (Carrefour/Lidl) are a short drive or about 15 minutes' walk.  Free and easy parking - we didn't need to use the car for our entire stay. Helpful owner provided maps and tips.",Nothing,10

Accommodation is clean, spacious, bright and equipped with everything you need and it's super close to lovely bars and restaurants, the free ferry to Oostend and exceptional beaches. Owner was incredibly helpful too, changing his work schedule to allow us to arrive early. Really wish we had stayed here for longer and can't believe we have overlooked Oostend in the past. Would definitely stay here again. ",Everything was perfect!,10

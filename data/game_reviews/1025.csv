14547,Thon Hotel Brussels City Centre,Quite elaborate and the food was well done. The variety was excellent. The juice was fresh and the chocolate was a bonus,"The bed left little passage on ether side. Towels in bathroom were old, the shower was a bit squeezed in the bath tap.

15180,Thon Hotel Brussels City Centre,"The proximity to the city centre, the public transport and the gard du midi. It's ease to check in and out. The view from the sauna (apart from the huge cranes). The Nespresso machine, free water and the cleanliness of the room. Plus, the TV had a few English channels which passed the evening away before bed. ",That the entire building and its surroundings weren't finished and the building work started at 7am (if not earlier). The ice machine didn't work. Two of the four lifts didn't work. The 'fitness' floor was dire and the 'spa' was much to be desired. The front of the hotel is covered in scaffolding so you can't see the building making it easy to walk by.,5.8

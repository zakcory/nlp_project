15129,Hotel Banks,"The staff were really helpful. The location is great, close to so much and easy to find. The breakfast and service was great too. Our room was lovely and the bed very comfy. I would definitely stay again.","I was a little disappointed that they stocked the bedroom with water bottles rather than just having tap water. It was also a shame that there was no mimi fridge in the room, but with drinks provided downstairs it wasnt too much of a problem.",7.5

15424,Hotel Banks,good location / cosy lobby,"Rooms are clean but they feel less than basic / wifi didn't work / the heating was not sufficiently strong to heat up the room, it was cold. I paid 180 EUR for a night .. for this price I could book a 5-star in the same street",5.8
15487,Hotel Banks,location,"booked a room which  stated it was tiny, there was no room to walk around the bed, don,t think this should be advertised as a double room more of a single. The only upgrade was the junior suite which was ¬£120 more for the two nights, i could have stayed in a far nicer hotel for the same money, I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone and will definitely not stay there again, there was only a part roll of toilet paper there on arrival, on the Sunday we went back to the room at 5pm to change for the evening and our room had not cleaned or clean towels.",5.4
15515,Hotel Banks,"Location was great, communal are was nice.","On the 5th floor and 1 elevator, and a very noisy one at that. Took a while to get to sleep with the constant noise.",6.3

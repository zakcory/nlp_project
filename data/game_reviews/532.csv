1588,Hof Leskensdaele,It's an amazing place with a very high standard in a pretty location. I think it's actually really underpriced for what it offers!

1526,Hof Leskensdaele,"The accommodation is a group of lovely old buildings approximately 6km outside Geraardsbergen. The whole place is beautiful with guests being able to use the large lounge and kitchen areas. There's plenty of outdoor space with a large landscaped garden. It was perfect as a base for cycling. I was met by the owner who showed me around including a secure place to store my bike. The room was modern and well equipped. The owner was very helpful and even let me use the room to shower in after I had checked out, which was fantastic. I wish I could have stayed longer and will definitely go back again.",Nothing really. My only niggle was the fact that because it was summer and I had my windows open I could hear a fountain in the Courtyard all night from my room.,9.2
1605,Hof Leskensdaele,,The room was very cold. And the water wasn't hot to take a shower.  I was force to go out like that without having my bath,3.8

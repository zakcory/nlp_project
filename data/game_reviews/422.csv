Unable to fix..so to toilet in the dark. Compensation was free breakfast. Next morning, no water on top floor, clearly a pressure problem, new receptionist had no cloe, ""new problem, never had complaints"". Then he wanted us to pay for breakfast :(  I'm not a complainer but this was bad! Do not get fooled by rating..hotel without a soul, and nobody who takes responability for it.",2
14143,Dansaert Hotel,"Rooms are clean and modern. Good location, easy walking distance to shops and Grand Place. Close to transport services and the Eurostar station is less than ten minutes by car. Staff were very helpful and apologetic about the renovations/lack of breakfast.","The rooms don't have aircon, so we were given a standing fan that basically swirled hot air around. The rooms facing the street are quite noisy for all the bars and pubs surrounding the hotel. The room rate included breakfast which we were told could not be provided due to renovations at the property. Pillows are awful.",6.7

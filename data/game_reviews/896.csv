The breakfast has some home made cake and stuff as well as apples and oranges from the garden.","The room was not super-clean. We found some leftovers in the fridge from previous guests and there were some butterflies killed on the wall. The small terrace was basically unusable. There is no shower, only a bath tub where showering is an adventure. It was not clear from the beginning that we had to pay a surcharge of 10% (14$) for our dog, and we discovered at the moment of the check out. All in all it was a bit too expensive.",6.7

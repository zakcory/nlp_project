26150,De Pastorie,"The room was pretty good, and the breakfast was ok.","The parking is on the small village square, and if you arrive late, all spots will be occupied by locals. Upon arrival we found the main entrance locked, and a sign requested us to call by phone, if you have one, for staff. We managed to locate a back door where we found an employee, who also spoke English. There was also some ""mixup"", so the bed wasn't made, this was eventually fixed. After leaving we realized that we had been charged EUR 20 more per night (3 nights) than agreed in the reservation. Unfortunately we didn't have the reservation papers available when paying, but that probably had changed nothing, as the person only spoke Dutch/Flemish and we don't.",5.4

26110,De Pastorie,"If you are looking for a place to relax, with great walking and bicycle paths, this is the place.  The place is quiet and very close to the city.  The breakfast is exceptional and there is a cafe at the hotel just to relax.  Downtown is just 15 minutes away as well as other small towns.  The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.  Free parking, breakfast and internet.",Everything was great.,10
26136,De Pastorie,The owner was a very nice lady. The breakfast was amazing.,"I would not recommend this place. On the pictures it looked really great but I did not feel comfortable inside the room. The room was large but not cosy. To reach the toilet I had to pass a hall and two doors. Somehow I was given a barrier-free room even though the hotel did not seem to be booked out. Right outside the hotel there was a cemetery and absolutely no light in the surrounding. It was very scary to come back to the hotel late evening. It was also very hard to find a place initially as Google Maps does not show the address correctly. Had the price been half of what it actually costed it would have been ok, but for this price one can find better places in Belgium in my experience.",3

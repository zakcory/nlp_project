12923,B&B N¬∞5,"Room size, bathroom and little touches they add to make you feel special, the breakfast is a Downton Abbey feel. ",Our stay was too short,9.6
12860,B&B N¬∞5,"Genial.Extremely clean, comfortable and beautiful. We appreciated the little details and the flexibility; great breakfast, great hosts, great place.",,10
12747,B&B N¬∞5,Lovely B&B. The only thing is that the breakfast is not included in the price of the bed and breakfast. It isnt mentioned you have to pay extra on top of your stay. So that was a surprise. Cause the owner wasn't present when we had to pay I emailed her about this (twice) but she didn't replay at all. That a shame.,,8.3
12834,B&B N¬∞5,"Beautiful room in an ancient bourgeois house renovated with taste and some modern touch. Enjoyed the sauna, the excellent breakfast and the location in the historical heart of Liege.",,9.6
12899,B&B N¬∞5,Everything was perfect. This is the second 10 I give in 5 years of using booking.,,10
12698,B&B N¬∞5,Beautiful building original main house and super renovation in the other.  The bed was very comfortable and breakfast superb.,Unfortunately there was a lot of noise from the square in front until late.  There are a lot of drunks etc. in Liege unfortunately.  It's such a shame - a perverse difference between the superb cultural scene and people in the saddest situation..not the fault of the B&B of course but the local government could be doing a lot more to help this appalling drugs problem that Liege clearly has.,8
12944,B&B N¬∞5,Not sure where to start! A very warm welcome from the very friendly owners who showed us to our rooms which were just stunning. They have clearly spared no expense to build perhaps one of the most comfortable B&Bs we have ever stayed in-  fabulous bed and a big fan in the 35 C heat! To finish a delicious breakfast in a stunning breakfast room,,10

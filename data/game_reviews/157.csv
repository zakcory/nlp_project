24958,B-aparthotel Regent,"Efficient service, and large spacious room.  Check-in procedure was well arranged and easy to follow the instructions. Central location, but not too crowded or busy, and only about 15 minutes walk to the centre.  A fair number of bars, restaurants, cafes located very close within walking distance.","We stayed over the weekend, so no staff were present (this we knew in advance so isn't a criticism).  However, things like the coffee machine only had two coffee pods for two people for two nights - there are no refills available, and no one at reception to speak to for example about this.  Also, the kettle, coffee machine, microwave, and lamp all shared one plug which doesn't seem safe or sensible.  Again, small issues but easily avoidable and not an expensive cost.",7.1

18851,Auberge de la Lesse,Food is good - needs maintenance and upgrading of outdoor areas - not sufficient pool chairs and pool is surrounded by gravel and overlooked by busy parking lot and traffic as well as restaurant area.,"Ground floor rooms are dark and very basic - got a room on upper level which was better but still very basic in terms of appointment. Sewers we're blocking and smelly during the night. Lots of maintenance needed not least for safety related issues: trip dangers  and dirty outdoors stairways full of bird droppings, Hose pipes across walkways",5.4

15368,B&B Aux Quatre Bonniers,Ample and well furbished room and large bathroom. It wasn't very warm outside when I arrived and I really appreciated that the room was already heated when I arrived. The hosts are very nice and provide lots of information about the area. The breakfast was extensive and made of home made or local products. The property has a library and very nice garden that are free to use.,"Not many restaurants in the immediate area but with a car reachable within a 10 minute drive.  Regarding the property itself, there is nothing to improve.",9.6

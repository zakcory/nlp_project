14588,Hotel Professor,"Have been many times at Hotel Professor as former student in Leuven 20 years ago visiting the city on a regular basis and its always nice especially when I get my favourite room at the hotel as happened this time. Besides this the hotel (I assume I am not offending anyone by saying it is more like a guesthouse, not being so fancy at all), is just perfectly located in town.",This time it was not as much live around the cocktail bar downstairs as it used to be before when I have been visiting (also of course meaning it was now very quiet for the night being beneficial for the guests sleeping over this time). The breakfast at the hotel is always very good while this time I was told it ended at 10 clock while homepage still says it should be 10.30.,8

Rooms are well laid out and a good size.","In a bit of busy location, but it was the height of summer. We had room 1 and the shower could do with a bit of TLC. The shower head would not stay up and it leaked in several places all over the bathroom floor. Had to use a towel to mop it up",7.9

The decoration at the whole hotel is quite old-stylish, which we really enjoyed. Check-in was done very smoothly and contactless. The breakfast was delicious and the service was amazing.  The hotel is right at the beautiful beach and only a few minutes walk away from cafes and restaurants. 100% recommend !","There was nothing we didn't like, this place exceeded our expectations and we would come back to stay here again!",10

5326,B&B Les Hirondelles,"Charming cottage in La Concession district, at 100 m from the beach and the dunes. Very comfortable beds, spacious apartment, we had a whole floor just for us! Perfect for savoring the flavor of 'la belle epoque'.",,10
5179,B&B Les Hirondelles,"Quiet location, relatively easy access to the promenade, a few hundred metres.","No TV in the rooms, especially in this day and age of electronics. Toilet and shower in the bedroom with open top to the room. Privacy reduced. vapour and smell can permeate the room. Toilet and washbasin very cramped, especially if you are 1,7m or taller. I booked and paid for a normal room and a deluxe room. Both were the same. Stayed there previously and was happy with the room size on the ground floor. Not again",6.7

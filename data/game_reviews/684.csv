6280,Hotel Castel,"It is very centrally located out of the central station.  Other attractions are about 20-25 minutes away if you are at a leisurely pace.  Alternatively, you can take the city's tram into the heart of old town. ","The room rate was not incredibly high but it was not quite value for money if facilities provided were only limited and if the room size was just not spacious enough.

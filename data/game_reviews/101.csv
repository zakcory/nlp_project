105,AppartHotel Belle Vue,Helpful and responsive staff. Room was quite a big apartment. Nice private parking despite being inbthe middle of the city.,"Breakfast was a bit limited, not included in the not very cheap price of the room. Water took very long to heat up in the shower, maybe because room was on the top floor but this was rather wasteful.",7.5

165,AppartHotel Belle Vue,"Normal size room, clean, quiet (as on the back of the property). Eager to help receptionist, she explained calmly all the issues. The access to the room and main entrance is done with a code, should keep it with you if not memorize it.","The entrance to the parking is extremely narrow; I had some problems to avoid scratching the car. Personally I needed some guidance to go straight. So, not suitable for big cars.",6

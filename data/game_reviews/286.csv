19148,Begijnhof Hotel,"Didn't have the opportunity to stay long this hotel as we checked in quite late and had to leave early due to travel plans.  Check in was easy and the person on the desk was very helpful.  My room was excellent, it appears the hotel is in the process of refurbishment.  Breakfast was very good, great selection.  Parking was a little tight due to the building and the vehicle size we were travelling in.  Would definitely recommend a stay here and would return when back in Leuven.",,8

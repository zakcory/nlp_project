16664,Hotel Koffieboontje,"The location of the hotel is superb; it's just behind the belfry tower, and every attraction is within walking distance. The room is more spacious than I expected, and it includes a small kitchen, microwave, and fridge which is very convenient. The staff are friendly, and the hotel is very flexible with check-in and check-out hours. Overall, great value for money ",The kitchen light in our room would occasionally turn off and on again after a while. The mattress and pillows can be better,8

18649,Hotel Koffieboontje,,"Room smelt musty, bathroom sink smelt of sewage, bar at the rear noisy till 3am, double bed was two singles pushed together so slumped in the middle, Wifi was very hit and miss if it was working and room was covered in dust, also found hair in the bed. 
All round worst hotel experience I've ever had. ",3.8
18977,Hotel Koffieboontje,Nice staff. In the heart of the city.,"Insanely smaller than expected. Paper thin walls. Bare minimum accommodations. All things I'm ordinarily fine with, but this was proved the same as other hotels in the area that seemed to have much more generous accommodations. I'm sure it was priced this was because of the location, but I could have used a heads up. I would have stayed a few blocks away for the same price In an actual room.",5.4

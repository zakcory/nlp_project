21138,Hotel 't Putje,"Location is nice, next to fairly priced parking garage and walking distance to the entire city centre. The room itself was spacious and had three separate beds. Personell was friendly.","Hygiene was bad. Fungus in the bathroom, blower was clogged. Lot of dust on the towel heater. Several long hairs on the ground. Floor in the badroom should be replaced. Clearly no attention to details. Next to this, there were lots of drunk people walking past the hotel at night, I would recommend bringing earplugs. This is what could be expected from a 6.0 rated cheap hotel, not a hotel with this price and rating.",5.8

Also great location, and has clean cute rooms.","Lovely hotel, but did not like the smell of the building and room.
The bathtub was nice and big, but if you like to shower, you might not like the 4th floor as you can't stand in the tub due to slanting of the roof.",8.3

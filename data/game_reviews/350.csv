5580,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,"Reading all the reviews we were expecting our room to be an absolute nightmare. It turned out to be decently clean and comfortable. Equipped with just the bare basics, a bed 2 chairs and a sink. The bedding was clean and the room did not feel too dirty although it could certainly do with some freshening up of the curtains and floors. It was fine for a one night stay. We stayed on a Saturday where the pub downstairs is open throughout the night. We did not find it too loud and were able to sleep. Absolutely incredible location; right at the centre. The pub is a great place to have a drink after a long day of sightseeing",Bathrooms could be cleaner. There was also no handsoap in any of The toilets.,7.1

6075,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,,"Got bites by a bedbug in a six-bed dorm! 
I have caught the bedbug and brought it to the redemption. They just gave me another bed in a four-bed dorm and comment that it's pretty enough for me in that situation. 
Highly NOT recommend!",2.5
5083,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,"Very nice location.
The hostel also has a pretty cool bar downstairs with pool.
","In the morning there was a cut off of electricity.
The showers had cold water, and the regulation of temperature was not possible, it was just a press button.
5$ deposit for the key, if you dont ask back for it they could forget it.",6

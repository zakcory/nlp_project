5045,Hotel Du Parlement,"Handy location for parliament and surroundings, good size room. Decent powerful shower (though there was no holder for it), nice old building with high ceilings and pleasant staff.","Maybe don't stay in room 13! Was not the cleanest room, mattress did not quite fit the bed, furniture and fittings were very worn. curtains very thin and also did not quite cover the window, so did not block out the flashing light form the kebab house opposite - this did thankfully stop flashing at about 11pm, though this was only on a Tuesday night.",6.3
5059,Hotel Du Parlement,"location was nice in lively neighbourhood, relatively close to subway","smell of sewerage in the room on the third floor, bathroom, room could do with proper renovation and modernisation. Very seventies like. Coffee and tea making facilities but no tea of coffee available",6.3

5456,Hotel Du Parlement,N.A.,"The hotel is a very bad choice given the price they charge and compared to other hotels in the same area. Interior is in bad shape, no wardrobe, dresser full with towels and no space for own clothes. The bathroom is run down and with broken door and sink. Cheap and carelessly chosen furnishing. No wonder one has to pay in advance before seeing the room. Clear recommendation to stay away!",4.2

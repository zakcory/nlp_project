17774,Hof Van Spanje,"This place is utterly stunning. Perfectly clean, warm and comfortable with the most amazing views. The best location and has a small market, cafe and all the main attractions right on the door step.",The check in was a little fussy on arrival but sure it was just a one-off. Parking was a little tricky but I did have a van so didn't expect it to be easy. REEP car park was 10 minutes walk and cost 36 euros over the two days. Bargain in my opinion.,10
17902,Hof Van Spanje,"This place is exactly as seen in the photos.  There is a big wow factor when entering!  The location is fabulous!!  It's an easy, short walk to everywhere you want to be, there are lively pubs on the street, a fruit market and public square are right out the door. We liked almost everything! The toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom.  This was very helpful for our group of 4. We would absolutely return. Be aware that it is on the top floor, so step climbing is mandatory. The upper balcony is a fantastic place!!!","The beds were rather hard and not very comfortable.  Our two teens opted to sleep on the couch, which is HUGE.  My kids are very tall and fit fine",9.2
17890,Hof Van Spanje,Location can not be better! Great comfort! Superbly clean flat!,"Not a dislike but staff is not always around I think. I've waited some time for anybody to open the door. Again at check out, I've looked for somebody to drop the keys off. It took some time.",8.3
17798,Hof Van Spanje,"Loved this apartment, perfect central location. Excellently stocked kitchen and lovely welcome (thanks for the bottle of wine!). Highly recommend and would happily stay again.",,10
17960,Hof Van Spanje,"Great location down the street from Friday Market -- walked everywhere.  Apartment as seen in photos, clean, great atmosphere, loved the exposed brick walls, gas fireplace, nice decor, terrace, views of church towers from bedroom windows. Book this apartment if available.",,10
17878,Hof Van Spanje,Fantastic location and beautiful apartment.,Stairwell smelled really bad. Kitchen was okay but could have been better equipped for those who wanted to cook much.,9.2
17826,Hof Van Spanje,"This property is BEAUTIFUL! Clean, classy. A kitchen to prepare meals if you don't want to eat out every night. The living/dining area is very nice plus, there is a rooftop deck patio for dining. The location was on a square surrounded by dozens of fine eating, drinking and dining and is easy walking distance to everything. Fully recommend!","The location was excellent, except - on Friday night the nearby nightclub music was blaring well into the early morning making sleep very much impossible. I don't know how this can be remedied, but short of noise ordinance after 0200.  Most of my stay was during the weekday, and except for Friday, it was quiet and perfect!!!",9.6

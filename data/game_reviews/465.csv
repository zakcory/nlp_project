6727,Flandria Hotel,"The description of the Hotel is very correct. No frills hotel in the historic centre of Ghent and the right price when compared to other hotels in the centre of Ghent. We had a rather spacious room with bathroom at ground floor, the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast is basic but still ok. Everyone was very helpful and our room was quiet and cosy after turning on the heating.",Maybe it requires some TLC.,7
7081,Flandria Hotel,The staff were lovely. The bed was clean and comfy. Hotel ideally situated for centre of Ghent.,Parking a problem and most roads leading to hotel are now one-way which my sat-nav had no idea about. The hotel itself is in a very poor condition. It is clearly very old with lots of wonky floors and a winding staircase which is difficult to get suitcases up but my main complaint was was the state of our room. The decor hasn't been touched in a very long time and the electrics - well - I was so worried we would be electrocuted. The toilet cistern was not attached to the wall and the whole place felt grubby.,7.1

23877,Best Western Plus Park Hotel Brussels,"Good size for a single room. Very quiet, even though the hotel was fully booked. Very close to the metro station. Nice view from the window. Kettle +coffee and tea provided (but weird creamer thing instead of milk). The bathroom had a bathtub which is always a plus. Free wi-fi. Free bottle of water on first day.","Very small bed and even smaller quilt, so I didn't get proper sleep. I booked the best western specifically because I remembered their huge double beds (at least in the US), but the bed in my room was so small i could barely fit and I am not a big woman. Also, the quilt was quite small and every time I moved, a part of my body was left exposed. Finally, I am not a big fan of carpet, it always feels like it's not that cleanand there was a big ruined spot by the bathroom.",7
23664,Best Western Plus Park Hotel Brussels,"Great location, kind staff (the one person who was there) beautiful garden.",Shut down everything for Covid. I do understand but Booking and website should flag and even then the hotel should at least provide a small kettle in room and provide pro active information to travelers as to how to find something to eat. Decor a bit dated but fine.,7

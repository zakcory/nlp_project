13383,Value Stay Brussels Expo Hotel,"I used to stay here ( it had a different name) regularly when  I worked with a nearby company.  Last stayed over 5 years ago. Not much has changed in the rooms, they are fine.  The check-in has limited open hours and there is no longer a bar and the original breakfast room is no longer used.  The late check-in procedure worked well, did not try the breakfast. The restaurant next door is still good.",Not as friendly as it used to be.,7.9

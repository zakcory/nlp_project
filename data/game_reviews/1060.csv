9838,Victoria & SPA Minsk,Good location and amenities at the hotel,,10
10315,Victoria & SPA Minsk,"The location of the place was amazing and with a good view
","The staff weren't cleaning the room efficiently. For example, when it comes to cleaning the bed, they just put the blanket and don't care whether there's anything under the blanket such as shirts, charge and others. 
And even though it's safe but there is no camera's in the elevators and stairs where there should be.",7.1
10273,Victoria & SPA Minsk,WiFi was excellent.  Location good.  Staff mediocre.  Lobby staff was much better than spa staff.,"It was odd that you had to take your hotel towel to the spa.  Nobody smiles.  Nobody is friendly.  I think it's more of a cultural thing but a smile and ""hello"" and a response of ""you're welcome"" goes a long way and nobody says any of that.",7.1
10195,Victoria & SPA Minsk,"The location, cleanliness","Even though there were free rooms, the reception informed us to pay for half day to check us in just 2 hours before their check-in time.",7.1
10108,Victoria & SPA Minsk,A clean and large room. Good spa services.,I do not recommend the hotel's restaurant.,6
9825,Victoria & SPA Minsk,"Room is clean. 
Friendly staff. 
Tasty in-room food. ","I booked a room in the Viktoria & SPA hotel only for one night with a big hope to use their spa facilities. However, my hope wasn't fulfilled, as their swimming pool area, jacuzzi and sauna/steam room all were full up with about 20-30 people. During these COVID-19 times I expected to see some restrictions in place on amount of people can attend spa zone.

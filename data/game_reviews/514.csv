1714,Guesthouse Bernardin,Nice calm and cleaver designed hotelroom in the middle of Atntwerpen,Little dangerous staircase,9.6
1596,Guesthouse Bernardin,"the rooms (I would also say the ""houses"") are pretty, lovely, cosy, well designed. The accommodation is very very authentic and original. It is well located in the center, but it is also quiet. I would love it more if it was a little cleaner. And I would also change the cosmetics to be upper level",Cathedral was under huge constructions (May 2021) but it is not disadvantage of the guesthouse,9
1777,Guesthouse Bernardin,"Lovely hotel in a cluster of small houses grouped around a church in Antwerp city centre. Very helpful and friendly host. Beautiful breakfast. Every 'room' is in fact a tiny house with a first floor and a bedroom, sitting room, etc. All decorated with taste.",,9.6
1736,Guesthouse Bernardin,"It's a charming guesthouse, small but very nice and comfortable. Everything is very functional, including the collapsible shower walls. The bed was very comfy and the breakfast very nice - and delivered to our door! Would certainly recommend staying here. ","The floor was a bit dirty. The stairs are very steep, which was OK for us but maybe not for other people. ",7.9
1725,Guesthouse Bernardin,"Nicely located. Loved the mix of the old church wall, the old floor with the modern shower and furniture. Staff was professional and friendly. Will come again, really enjoyed my stay! ",Some dust under the chair and bed in my room.,8.8
1830,Guesthouse Bernardin,"It's a lovely one bedroom house all to yourself. Comfortable bed, coffee machine, good shower, quiet location but super centrally located. The old church walls are the interior walls for much of the property, providing quirky architecture and loads of charm. Would stay again.","I would have preferred a sofa in the living room rather than two seats. This is nitpicking though, it's a great guesthouse.",9
1789,Guesthouse Bernardin,,"Everything was really tiny and looked way bigger on the photos. The stair are really steep therefore it's impossible to get the luggage to the bedroom, but there wouldn't be space anywhere.. We wanted to sleep a little bit longer but they clean the appartment only till 11am. ",5.8

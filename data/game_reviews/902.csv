There weren't any radiators in the room. It felt like a fridge. Informing and complaining the hotel staff didn't help. Room temperature was well below 18 C.,5

3310,Marivaux Hotel,"Very comfortable room, rather spacious, all clean and nice. We were allowed an early check-in. Within walking distance of central station and all attractions - which was very convenient.","We had a room overlooking some kind of space between buildings, some other windows facing our window within very short distance so we kept the curtains closed almost the whole time. Also - not much daylight coming in. Only 2 Nespresso capsules available per day for free. ",9.2

2925,Marivaux Hotel,"The room was like a prison cell with a small window looking at the front wall in 2 meters and still they call it deluxe room and charge for 180 euros a night. The breakfast was very basic, most hostels have similar or better, cold coffee and tea and still u have to ask for it. Don't waste your money by staying at this hotel","Room, breakfast",4.2

22767,Hotel Continental Gare du Midi,"The hotel is close to the Midi railway station, and 15 minutes by foot from the touristic city center. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and clean.","There was a persistent smell in the room. The window could not be opened and was half broken (anyway, it was over a busy road). The wifi did not work (or there was no instructions and it was completely non standard, so that the result was the same). The breakfast was minimal, with stale bread and ham slices in open air (but coffee and orange juice were OK).",5.4

23201,Hotel Continental Gare du Midi,,"It is very dirty, both in the room and in hotel facilities ( stairs). Our windows were to the railway road.  High noise followed us whole nights. We could hardly hear each other in the room while tried to talk. Never had same experience before of such uncomfortability",4.2
22717,Hotel Continental Gare du Midi,"From the arrival, the experience was above my expectations: the staff offered us, for free, tea and hot chocolate and looked for rooms that best suited our request. The man at the reception was really kind, he gave me all the information I needed, really accurately and with no hurry. He was really hospitable. The rooms were clean and with everything we needed, even if furniture was a bit dated (my mother fell in love with the curtains!). The location is good: it is a bit far from the centre, but well connected using public transport.",,8
22937,Hotel Continental Gare du Midi,"Good location for train travellers
Good price
Spacious room
Bed was ok","Room was a bit too warm though the heating was switched off. 
Noisy area but that's not surprising next to a train station.
Old towel in the bathroom, that has not been removed. But new ones were also there",7.1

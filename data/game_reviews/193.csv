1236,B&B De Vossenbarm,"The rooms are extremely well decorated and the breakfast in beautiful dining room was nothing short of exceptional. The location was perfect for those with a car, perfectly situated between Bruges and the Belgian coast. However the best aspect of this property was the wonderful hospitality. We were made to feel extremely welcome and comfortable. We'd highly recommend this property to visitors travelling through Belgium. ","The property is perfect. The only issue we had was that we travelled during a highly unusual heat wave and as with most Belgian properties, our room was more adapted to cooler weather than hotter weather. Not a criticism - as I said, the property was fantastic - but a fan would have been handy. ",10
1288,B&B De Vossenbarm,Everything was fabulous. Christine was an excellent host and the breakfast was excellent. Highly recommend this place.,,10
1269,B&B De Vossenbarm,"Amazing place with beautiful nature. Christine is very kind and hospitable. We had a pleasant time. The room is stylish and made with love. Breakfasts were super fresh and tasty. 
We will miss your horses.

1279,B&B De Vossenbarm,"Excellent breakfast, beyond any expectations. And I mean, both for food and atmosphere. Lovely landscape, friendliness and relax.","Just to make De Vossenbarm perfect, I'd suggest to improve acoustic insulation of the rooms. If other clients move during the night, it is not perfect.",10
1320,B&B De Vossenbarm,Well positioned for my proposed itinerary.  Excellent breakfasts. Informative and helpful hostess.,Cannot really think of anything!,8.3
1332,B&B De Vossenbarm,Breakfast was fantasic,Beds (but that is of course personal) were way to soft for my taste. Lots of animal noise. We were woken up by a cow at 7 who did not stop.. but that is of course the country side,8
1326,B&B De Vossenbarm,"We opted for a place outside Bruges to stay away from the crowds and our choice couldn't have been better. The b&b is located just outside town and ideal to explore also the beautiful countryside, specially if you have a bike or rent one. But it was our host, Christina, and her warm hospitality together with the exceptional breakfast she served us that made our stay really memorable. (She also provided us with all we needed to know to move around the area)",,9.6

420,ibis Hotel Brussels Airport,During covid times so not the full hotel experience. Great location - only 10 minutes drive from the Airport. Facilities look good although restaurant was closed due to lockdown. Plenty of onsite parking charged at 12Euro per night  A takeaway breakfast was catered for although nothing too fancy.,,8
748,ibis Hotel Brussels Airport,"very kind personnel. Clean room, comfortable bed, very well equipped bathroom, good WiFi and TV, enough storage. At one stone's throw from the airport. Due to Covid restrictions they served me a pretty good breakfast to have in the room. Very recommendable.",There's a light smell of cleaning products on the corridors,8.8
542,ibis Hotel Brussels Airport,The breakfast was very good,"Twice I was eating meat in the restaurant (spare ribs and chicken) and twice I had to ask for meat that wasn't overcooked /  fried so much that one could not use a knife. The service was great and swift with this, but I noticed an issue with cooking meat.. Salmon was ok, but again, it looks like this process is not going well. In the room I expected a water cooker to make tea. The vending machine didn't accept two euro coins, and waiting for a fix took too long.",7
785,ibis Hotel Brussels Airport,I am not able to find any advantage of this hotel.,Whole hotel was little bit dirty. Better to use cheaper hotel ibis few meters next to this one. It is cheaper solution and quality je almost the same. This hotel just hlave aircondition. By it is not worth almost double price as that cheaper one.,4

1069,Mini-Hotel La Menska,Cheap.,"The staff weren't helpful.  We have stayed in 3 hotels since in different areas in Belarus and all of the rest have registered us and made our stay easy. The lady at  reception gave no help, just a website to visit. It's also in the middle of nowhere. ",4.6
1039,Mini-Hotel La Menska,The staff was very hospitable. The rooms were new and clean.,The walls were very thin so sometimes I heard someone snoring. The mattress was very soft but maybe it would depend on your preferences.,7.9
1021,Mini-Hotel La Menska,The staff were really nice and helpful. The rooms were nice too. The on-site restaurant is good if not slightly expensive for Minsk but they were super accommodating. We don't speak Russian and everyone made a huge effort to communicate with and help us which was very much appreciated!,If you have a car it is fine. If you don't have a car you have to take a very long (almost one hour) mini van in to the city centre and it's not the most convenient thing ever. Also there is no ATM near by and you need cash to pay so heads up and bring cash with you!,6.7
1030,Mini-Hotel La Menska,"Clean and comfortable,basic breakfast","Language barrier with staff, they don't speak English.",8.3
1002,Mini-Hotel La Menska,It is clean,"Breakfast is very small (I uploaded photo). It is written 10 minutes from the train station. In fact, it is minimum 20 minutes by car, when there is no traffic. When it is traffic - 30 minutes.  The closest market is 10 minutes from hotel (by bus). It is written on the site, there is a hair drier in the room. It is not true. You must ask on reception to get a hair drier. Take into account if you need iron, on reception, can tell you that somebody other took it and he still has not returned it back. They do not accept credit cards, in both reception and restaurant. They do not accept foreign currency. So many things different that information they published on the site made me feel not comfortable there.",6.7
1094,Mini-Hotel La Menska,,I watched the hotel for reservation starting from 1:00 am in the morning. I had to pay extra for it. But they asked us to put the booking in the previous day (because their computer is not updated the date!!!!!) and had to leave before 12:00 pm next day (flight was in the evening). Do not use this hotel.,1
1058,Mini-Hotel La Menska,They're nice facilities anyway,Nothing I like everything,6

8183,Hostel Bruegel,"Although it was further than I thought it would be, it was just still a manageable 7-10 minute walk to Brussels Central train station. The size of the room and ensuite bathroom in the double room just surprised us as we thought it would be smaller.","The breakfast option could be improved. Only toast, cereal and a couple of fruits are your options.",9
8441,Hostel Bruegel,"4 bed dorm size is good
Free printing of boarding passes","Accessing the hostel from the shuttle bus stop can be difficult - 20 mins walk through a very rough area, can be dangerous at night. 
The toilets never had toilet paper in them, we had to constantly go down to the receptionist and complain about it.
The breakfast is very basic, and the dining area tends to get over crowded so I'd recommend going early for breakfast. ",6.3

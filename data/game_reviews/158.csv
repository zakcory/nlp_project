Also the apartment is very spatious.","The cleanliness could improve. There was a LOT of dust in the bedside tables. The bathroom had a huge patch of humidity that they could take care of. Finally, I would have expected them to refill the tea/coffee facilities.",5.4

The toilet's door is transparent. No privacy when you use it.",5

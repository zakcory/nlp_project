The apartment is spacious and has the essentials for a comfortable stay","Would be nice to be able to leave your suitcases somewhere for an early or late arrival, even for a fee. early arrival or late departure are expensive and this not being a hotel you cannot leave your suitcases and take advantage of your stay. The pillows are not great and a few more plates and cups would be appreciated.",7

5090,Smartflats Design - Cathedrale,Good place where to relax after a day of work during the Corona time. The apartment is placed in the middle of the city: daily necessities are very close by and there are quite a few parking garages to choose from (they have to be paid separately).,"I had two minor inconveniences during my stay: the dishwasher was not working and it was not possible to fix it during my stay. There was no door on the shower stall (I think it's like this by design) and I had to buy a mop to dry the bathroom floor. Regardless of the minor inconveniences, I am going to use a smartflats apartment again if the opportunity arises.",7

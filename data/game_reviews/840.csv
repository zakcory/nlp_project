24600,Hygge Hotel,Lovely staff,"1. Noise: Noise from the street, water noise from other rooms,
2. Shower: Water sprays to your face and not to top of your hat,
3. Location: Not the prettiest in Brussels
4. 2 type of pillows, both not comfortable
5. Every-time you enter the room, tv turns on. Why? Why should i touch it everytime to turn it off?",5
23486,Hygge Hotel,The room was a bit small but was very cozy  - scandinavian design and  very clean. Bed was comfortable. A minus - there is no closet to put the clothes like jackets and shoes.,"The location is quite far from city center/important attractions of Brussels (e.g. Grand Place)  approx 17/20 min walking, even from the Gare Midi - 3 stops by subway.  For shoppaholics, hotel is near one of the biggest streets of luxury shopping like LV, Tiffanys and others.",9.6
23255,Hygge Hotel,Amazing staff - gave great recommendations and booked a local restaurant which was fantastic. Great value for money.,Feel like we were just unlucky as the drainage in our bath room smelled bad. Bathroom looked very nice though. Asked to change room but was fully booked. Also had dirty sheets which had to be changed.,7.5
23628,Hygge Hotel,The hotel was beautiful and has a wow factor foyer area which is very inviting and cosy.   Our room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable.  The unique bathroom tiles were a nice extra touch and the shower was really good.  Staff were very friendly and more than happy to help with any requests.  We didn't have the breakfast there but it did look good from what we saw.,"There was some drilling going on when we checked in which was a little off-putting especially as we hadn't been notified of it but as we were out and about this didn't bother us too much.  Although in a nice area we were a bit further from the tourist area/main attractions (25min walk) so bear that in mind for your stay, ideally we would have been a bit closer but there is a metro station close by.",8.8
24062,Hygge Hotel,The lobby was nice,The room was very essential. I like Scandinavian minimalism but the room was too Spartan. There should be a difference between minimalism and Formule 1 budget hotels,5.8

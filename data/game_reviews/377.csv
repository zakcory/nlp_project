19818,Citadines Sainte Catherine Brussels,"The location of the property was ideal, walking distance to Grand Place, and lovely little streets to walk around on the way!  Staff were lovely and friendly, we especially loved the communal area on the ground floor, very chic and relaxed.  My daughter was able to do work on her laptop in a lovely relaxed space following check out.","The hallway to our room could have been better, as there were a few stains on the carpet and it had a slight smell of damp. but otherwise no complaints.",8.8
18987,Citadines Sainte Catherine Brussels,"Awesome location around Saint Catherine, quaint streets of food and shops to wander close by and walking distance to the Grand Place without the crowds/noise. Great to have Velvet Peck, Farm, and Yyoga just next door as well as a handy supermarket around the corner. Nice view of the canal from my front-facing window and great service from staff. Thanks! ","Room was simple, satisfied my expectations of Citadines but felt a little dated. Common areas are bright and spacious and modern, could be echoed in the rooms as well. ",8.3

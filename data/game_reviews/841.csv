24016,Hygge Hotel,,The room in the top of the building was like a sauna in the heatwave.,5
22304,Hygge Hotel,Beautiful cozy hotel with a lovely vibe. The colours and decor are all calming and very modern. Loved the area of the hotel great restaurants nearby and accessible to everywhere but a bit of the tourist trap,We had single beds and also the shower was too powerful to face down and could therefore only be held in hand,10
24200,Hygge Hotel,,The smell in the bathroom was very unpleasant.,7.1
24152,Hygge Hotel,The Hotel has a very nice architecture with really nice rooms in a renovated old building. The staff is friendly  and the coffee is great as well.,"BUT the hotel has no air condition, which is normally no problem in Brussels, but during these days in June the temperature in the room is above 25C! If you open the window it is almost impossible to sleep. Even if it is a side street it seems that people drive races in the road. Additionally a lot of loud people pass during the night. This means a no go for summer. A real pity as I liked the hotel style. I had also last morning a baguette which was so dry that I assume it was at least one day old..",6.3
23399,Hygge Hotel,"Stylish interior, great location, very cozy atmosphere.","Small things: too few clothes hangers in the room, coffee machine was out of milk, scrambled egg all gone when I was at the buffet.",8.3
23351,Hygge Hotel,"It was everything the name suggests and more, as it wasn't only very comfy and warm, but also practical",an extra power socket or USB charging socket at desk would have been a bonus,9.2
22886,Hygge Hotel,The hotel is well situated close to the shopping area. The size of the room is more than satisfactory and the design of the hotel is super chic.,"There is a smell of ""not used"" in the bathroom coming from the sewage. Maybe they should try to fix that for guests.",8.8

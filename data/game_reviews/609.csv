25379,Hotel AL Mulino,"We loved our stay here. We travelled by car so it was very easy to reach the city of Maastricht and the outlet village in Maasmechelen as well. The hotel itself is just lovely, it's a very unique building which we loved. The staff is just friendly and i'd give 12 out of 10 points for them! The restaurant inside was lovely too.  Our room was nice and clean, parkingspots provided. just highly recommended, we'll deffo come back here!",We actually don't have any negative points to be honest. We just loved it!,9.6
25394,Hotel AL Mulino,"The property is built under a mill, why's not to like?! 
It's a new decor kinda place and the room layout is funky, stylish and very modern. 
I only got a glimpse of the restaurant (closed due to covid) but it looked great and would definitely be an place I would revisit if I was in the area. 
The Owner is awesome and stayed up till 22:00 awaiting our arrival LEGEND! 
All in all this place has everything and looks great for a couple nights stay and it's very easy to find (just look for the massive mill and you'll be fine ) ",I loved it all.,10
25459,Hotel AL Mulino,"Well decorated rooms, good size.","Restaurant not open at night.  No tea or coffee making facilities in room. This is supposed to be a 4* hotel.  It isn't.  Say 3+. The rooms are very nice, but when you've been working and driving all day, the last thing you need is to go hunting for somewhere to eat.  My dinner was a packet of biscuits.  And tap water.  Great.  4* ?  I stayed a Mercure last night and that was a 4*, great meal, good room etc.",6.7

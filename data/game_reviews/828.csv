16131,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,Very silent despite proximity to highway.  Good restaurant inside the hotel,Windows could not open to change the air in the room.,8
16369,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,Good breakfast. Staff at breakfast.,"The room stank of sewage upon arrival. Nevertheless, I slept in, and informed reception staff in the morning. Nothing was done, and when I came back the room was as I left it - stinky. I traced the reason to a filthy shower curtain, that I showered for some time with the shower hand held telephone, and guess what, bad smell went magically away. I informed the lady at the reception before leaving, and she was very sorry, but her male colleague did nothing about it when he had to. Totally unacceptable attitude from the reception, and it's not the first time - a annoying episode happened one year ago. This was my third visit to the Ramada Woluve and it's going to be the last.",5

16109,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,The restaurant staff (Jamal) was fantastic!,No king size beds.,7.9
16548,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,"We have often used this hotel when visiting Brussels because it's in an excellent location for getting into the city centre and because it has good parking facilities. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the staff friendly and welcoming.",If paying the full price for breakfast it's very expensive compared to other hotels we've stayed in so we've often had breakfast in town for much less. It's good that there's a restaurant in the hotel (we were tired after a long drive and didn't fancy going out) but unfortunately the food we had suffered from spending too long in the microwave.,9.6
16257,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,Good location. Good breakfast.,Old and massive hotel! No ventilation in rooms.,5.4
16151,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,"Price. I was alone for 1 night and the (single) room rate was really cheap. Bath room was very modern and clean,",Building/Facility is a bit old. I traveled a lot and stayed at many different hotels but i don't think I ever wanna come back for this hotel. At least not for the full price. And it is very hard to find the hotel parking as some of  the roads near the hotel are closed for construction.,6.3

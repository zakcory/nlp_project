3334,Hotel Eurocap,"Breakfast was OK. Room was large, beds comfortable. However....","Bathroom was filthy. Excrement, presumably from previous occupant, smeared on toilet seat. No soap in bathroom. Asked at reception for these to be rectified, nothing was done. Not particularly cheap, given the state of the place.",4.2

3384,Hotel Eurocap,"Personel was nice, 24 reception, wifi worked well. Our room was cleaned everyday, which we didn't expect, so it's a big bonus. Breakfast place was open 24h (without breakfast itself obv, but there was a nice big space with tables and chairs where we could spend our time with friends from other rooms). Fridge in the room, kitchen in the room. Shower was great, with really hot water (if preferred) and great water pressure. In general I would recommend this place. ","Localization is medium. Not a lot of shops/restaurants nearby. Relatively close to expo. Lack of air condition, which hurts during hot days (we had a fan in out room though). Kitchens items were old/dirty. Breakfast was mediocre. Coffe/tea/juice, milk, some toasts and cheese. No meat, no anything hot except for coffee. ",7.9

The staff is really nice. 
It is very close to the city center. ","There was just a sliding door between the room and bathroom.
We could hear all our neighbors, the walls are too thin I think. 
The front door was making noise even if it was locked.
Early in the morning we smelled the breakfast while we were sleeping.
The toiletries were just towels and liquid soap. ",6

11845,Hotel Esperance,"The location is great, it is just in the city center. The staff is friendly and responsive.","The linen wasn't clean. After I've noticed it on reception, they changed it. Still, the impression is not the best. Also, sound isolation was very bad, so I've heard my neighbors.",7
12470,Hotel Esperance,"The hotel is ok, well situated-closed to the city center  and has a very good breakfast .","if you are staying on 5th floor the lack of an elevator is a problem. The girl from the reception desk was not very nice or helpful. As an advice, please double check your booking, because they will try to trick you and make you pay more for less.",6.3
12519,Hotel Esperance,The best thing was the jacuzzi bath and the bed was nice and bad and very comfortable . The staff were very helpful and friendly.,It was so hot in the room it was impossible to be comfortable. The listing of the hotel was very misleading. There was no sauna or gym facilities. It was just rooms above a tavern.  It was very overpriced . Also they run out of towels which is not acceptable when your paying $125 per night!!,6.3

Bedroom furnitures are quite new.","The lift is missing, the bathroom small, the main entrance needs renovations, stairs are extremely narrow and a bit dangerous as well.
No kettle for tea/coffee in the room but they provided hot water. 
Clean Towels were missing twice (in 3 days).",6.3

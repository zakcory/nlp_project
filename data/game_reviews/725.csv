12574,Hotel Esperance,Location great.,"No air conditioner.  When I asked at booking, I was told Belgium cool so it was not needed.  Room too warm during day so we avoided staying in the room during the day.  Outside street under repair.  Area noisy.  Handrail painted white was filthy.  We were on fourth floor (our 5th).  Stairs narrow.  Window had broken hinge upper right-hand corner so it did not work properly.  Paper basket would hold maybe a quart-sized bag.  We always had to find a bag or some way to contain trash.  Asked for an extra pillow, and it was there when we got back to the room in the evening.",5.8

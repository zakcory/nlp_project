","The room and bathroom were tiny but clean and modern. The fisrt room that we were offered was in the basement without natural light, humidity and small. After our disappointment, the manager change us to a room in the 2on floor with a better light and maybe bigger. ",7.5
22727,TripInn Eden Antwerp,"The main value is the position, close to the city centre and the central station. All the remaining services are pretty basic. Large room and bed. I cannot think of anything else positive but the price.",The cleanliness and level of maintenance of the room and the bathroom was just passable. I got a room at ground floor with very poor lighting and the window facing directly on the courtyard providing basically no privacy. Little space for clothes and luggage.,5

21905,TripInn Eden Antwerp,,"Might have just been unlucky myself but the right shower handle was broken, so very little and only cold water. Due to timing couldn't ask to fix it or change room that same morning (when I tried to shower). 
There was no receptionist in the morning to check out so I just left the key on the desk as I needed to leave in a hurry. ",6
21924,TripInn Eden Antwerp,The hotel is located in the city centre and the central station is just a 5 minute walk. The employee at the desk was friendly.,"The shower did not have hot water, unless you turned it on for 10 minutes. The employee told us this was because the hotel was almost empty.
We booked a room with a double bed (2 person), but got 2 single bed with a double mattress on top, and two single bed covers. Not really romantic.
We woke up a few time at night, because of staff shouting and slamming doors.
We had to pay an additional fee of 5 euros for city tax, which we were not aware of. ",6

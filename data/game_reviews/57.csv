25611,Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel,"Staff was friendly and helpful, breakfast is okay, everything I needed was there, but nothing special","It all looks a bit old and used, they rennovated the breakfast room during the stay.  I know its the European Quarter and everything, but 140 $ per night is not justified in any way.",6.3
25827,Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel,I really liked the second room when I changed (not on the street and larger),"The 3 first nights were not really comfortable as the room was not quiet and I smelled cigarette smoke (I am allergic and have breathing problems). Happily, thanks to the kind staff, I could change the room for the last 2 days.",7.1
25785,Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel,"Nice personnel, breakfast was ok.","Room was old, walls long time ago should be repainted. For this price you could expect much more.",7.1
25499,Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel,"Close to the center of the city, the subway and the Central, Shuman and Luxembourg railway station. The staff was very friendly","It is not specified that the accommodation has rooms on semi-basement, the price being the same regardless of the floor. I get such a room with relatively high humidity for 5 days of accommodation. Carpet on the floor does not help against mold. The windows had only a simple opening system. Good luck we use the camera just for sleep; bad luck that after a day with the closed window, in the evening was a pretty unpleasant smell in the room.",7.1
25572,Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel,I've really liked the hotel's location: it's very close to the city center and the old town. In 5 mins walk you can easily get to the Royal Palace and the park. Metro station Trone is in 100m distance from the hotel entrance.,I didn't like that the cleaning service wasn't included in the whole payment of staying. We needed to pay extra if we needed to clean the room.,7.1
25486,Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel,"I like adagio""s apartments with equipped kitchen.","We stay in hotel 7 nights and there isn't rooms cleaning services, change towels and bed sheets. every morning was same breakfast. The staff didn't help us to change booked rooms and we pay for  one room extra.",5

9370,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,Breakfast,"Unlike the last time I stayed here, things have gotten far far worse.
Elevator was not working at all, no signal of internet in my room, had to hang in the hallway (even there it was terrible and losing the signal all the time), no toiletries in the bathroom (soap at least ffs).
No early breakfast can be scheduled if departing early.
The electricity went out one evening.
Shower's water pressure was weak and the water not that hot. ",4
9288,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"Nice rooms, big bathroom. There was a table in the room with plenty of chairs, which was nice. some places to put your clothes, even hangers. Breakfast was good, nothing special - cereal and toast, there was coffee, orange juice - enough to go through the morning.","In my room there was no wifi, although it worked in all the other rooms. Me and my roommates tried to ask the staff to fix it, but they didn't, so throughout all of my stay I had no wifi. I think the staff didn't put too much effort into solving our problem bc wifi worked in all the other rooms, and that attitude makes me sad. Also take your own lock (costs 4 euros at the reception) and towel, it's 3 euros to rent it.",5
8871,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"The work starf were friendly, the breakfast is ok, the room was clear. It's very nice that the hostel is located next to the river.","1) . I booked it  over one month before I started my journey, I did hope I could have the peacful relax juring the stay, but they told me I will move to another room after two nights, I asked why, there were a big travle group will come soon, their anwsered. I had to do my packing and checked outbefore 10 am, and then checked in after 3 pm, that means there were 5 hours out of the servic, and my rest time was disturbed rughly, I do hope they would have some suitable way later.",8.3
7727,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"Fair distance to the subway station, nice pub with friendly staff, big bathroom for the private room","Food options are quite limited, especially if you arrive in the evening, on weekends, like we did. The hostel pub only has drinks, some little snack would be  useful. The double room, gorund floor, only has some upper windows, if you want some light in, then people walking outside could look directly into your bed",7
9383,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,The bed area was clean and comfortable. The staff was also super helpful.,The restroom smelled terrible and was quite dirty. There wasn't even handsoap in the restroom. The shower wouldn't drain either!,4

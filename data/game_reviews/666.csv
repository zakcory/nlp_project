1754,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Perfect location .. Very clean and comfortable rooms,
Great friendly staff.. only just tucked away from the main square, And a very short walk to loads of great restaurants and kerbside bars/Pubs .. pretty little Venice possibly!!","Would have preferred a room at the back of the hotel
As street noise might disturb you if your a light sleeper .. the odd car etc .
But it's not too bad on the whole. And probably not worth worrying about .. ",9.2

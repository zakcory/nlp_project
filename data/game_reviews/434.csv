Rooms was very spacious, with a big, comfortable bed.","I spent two nights in the hotel.  However, one of the windows facing the busy road outside was broken and did not close all the way. The staff tried to fix it to no avail.  A major construction site and busy traffic outside made sleeping from 07:00 onward impossible (despite being used to noise and having ear plugs). Heavy machinery has been on site for months and the construction work will continue for some time. That the management still asks for $120,- per night (breakfast not included and on weekdays) is unacceptable.",6

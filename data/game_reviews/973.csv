26205,Smartflats City - Royal,"I stayed at Smartflats Royal in Brussels.  The location is very good, the cleanliness of the apartment is also very good, fresh towels and bed linen.","A small TV, a lot of things were missing that would facilitate the use of the apartment, i.e. hangers for clothes at the entrance and in the bathroom, the photos differ from the appearance of the apartment in reality.",6
26240,Smartflats City - Royal,Location very central in Brussels,"What I did not like? Well, there was A LOT: - nails sticking out of the floor, so your socks got stuck and ripped - sticky stains on the floor - dirty floor, your socks were black just walking over it - trash behind the curtains - broken curtains so you could not open them on one window We informed Smartflats about the issues, but NOTHING happened.. so the service was also not acceptable.",2

26290,Smartflats City - Royal,The stuff on the telephone was very friendly,We asked at the day of arrival for a second blanked because there was only one big blanked per bed. Unfortunately it was only on the next day possible to have an extra blacked.,5

26354,Smartflats City - Royal,,"It went well we were able to contact quickly but when we checked out they told us there is water on the mattress and what can happen if you have children and they make a mess. For that reason they have taken my deposit of 150 $, which I cannot find because water dries naturally. I also said this via whatsapp to them, they said ""It's 7 working days after your check-out, it's automatically so no worry you'll have it any days now."" But they lied and i did not receive it !!
So I wouldn't book this if you had to pay a deposit !!!! They will look for something small to take your deposit anyway !!! ",1
26135,Smartflats City - Royal,"The location was perfect. 
Spacious open kitchen/ dining area
Seperate toilet away from the bedrooms. 
","The pillows were very small, and one was better quality than another. 
The floor was dirty, we never wear shoes inside either, so it was poorly cleaned before us. 
There was no baking paper or other simple items to make cooking easier. 
No lock on the bathroom door. ",8

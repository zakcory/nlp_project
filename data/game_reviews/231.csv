20141,B&B La Porte Cochere,"Everything. We arrived far too early and the owners were very accommodating. They allowed us to put our luggage in one of the rooms and gave us keys so we were free to return later. Also, when we vacated the room, they allowed us to leave our luggage to collect later.
Lovely breakfast,  Katrina and Steven were excellent hosts.
Less than five minutes walk to the square. Perfect location.","Everything was perfect

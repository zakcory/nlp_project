2841,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"I booked the room with canal view, that's fantastic, the room is very big and comfortable. Breakfast is ok and location is superb. You can walk from bus station to hotel within 2 minutes.",Nothing,10
2868,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Beautiful view of the canal, I highly recommend the canal view room huge rooms, basic breakfast, but walking distant to all the sights around town . Opposite the hotel is a great little restaurant that was reasonably priced too . Pizza Hut etc are all walking distance if you want.
Right in front of the hotel is the canal cruises. 2 min walk . 
Just a little warning though there are pick pockets apparently in January in particular. These scum are professional and can get into zipper bags etc watch your belongings . 
Apart from that the town is just divine . Try the cherry beer too it's yum ! ",,10
1908,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Breakfast and location both excellent. There was less food available for our last morning, but it was enough.",I only wish there could have been hot water for me to have a shower/bath. I was in Room 334 but had to ask my friends in Room 333 to use their shower.,7

2205,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Lovely staff, very friendly and welcoming and gave us some good tips on where to go. Stayed just the one night, but the hotel is in a great location and just around the corner from the market, would definitely go back!",,9.2
2923,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,The location is fantastic. All the staff we spoke with were friendly and helpful,"No mirror in the room, just in the bathroom, where it's difficult for my wife to use her hair drier. Overly complicated controls on the heating - couldn't adjust the temperature at all. Strangely, the toilet seat is set too high, ever sat on a toilet with your legs dangling? It's really uncomfortable. Breakfast food was fine, standard continental with good bread, but the breakfast room used to be a bar area, and the staff will insist on doing the washing up behind the 'bar', right next to the customers which is really noisy.  The coffee is terrible, stewed and weak.  You've got to read the label on the vacuum flask to check it's coffee as you can't tell from the flavour.",6
3052,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,Continental breakfast was good. The room had an excellent canal view. The staff were helpful in explaining the area attractions and organising taxis etc.,,10

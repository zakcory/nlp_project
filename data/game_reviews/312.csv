7251,C-Hotels Cocoon,"Good location, comfortable beds, clean rooms and nice interior.","The room and bathroom layout was not super practical. For example, when you open the door, you directly walk into the side of the closet and in the bathroom there is not enough place to put cosmetics and shower products.
What was really disappointing, is that the hotel closes at 10pm and there is no receptionist till early morning. You can enter the hotel with the room card but the first night of our stay it broke down (the system to swipe the card) and we could not enter the hotel with other guests for almost an hour. Even more disappointing is the fact that we did not receive any apology from the management which is unacceptable for a 4 starts hotel.",8

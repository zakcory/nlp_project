15266,Atrium,"Tasteful, clean and comfortable interior and spacious, sunny terrace; proximity to supermarkets, stores and main square around the corner; plenty of parking space in front; super-friendly host ensuring smooth key handover and providing some treats and useful material & information on the region.","Only minor things: parking in front of the house is partly payable, though there is free parking 5-10 mins by foot away; there's no dishwasher; the hairdryer is too weak for some.",10
15513,Atrium,"I travelled to Ypres as an Aussie especially to visit war graves and attend the Menin gate ceremony. The apartment is very comfortable with every facility and good wifi, and at the centre of Ypres (important locations, restaurants, etc.). Parking in the street is free from 6pm to 9am and a couple of hours mid-day. Otherwise about one euro per hour. Very highly recommended (and not only for the warm welcome!)",,10
15390,Atrium,Martine gave us a wonderful reception and tour of her lovely apartment which is located 2 minutes walk from the main square. The apartment is spotlessly clean and very homely. The roof patios front and back meant we could sit out and take in the views in the evening and for breakfast. We would highly recommend this lovely apartment.,All excellent,10

2471,Art de Sejour - B&B,"The room was beautiful with a really big, comfortable bed.  The bathroom was spotless and had a really good selection of L'Occitan toiletries.  There was free sodas and water as well as tea and coffee plus chocolates and biscuits.  There was also plenty of space to store clothes and suitcases. The breakfast was excellent with fresh juice and really nice bread. Alvin welcomed us and was very helpful.  He gave us a map and suggested places to eat and drink.  We went to one of those places and it was great. We would stay here again next time we're in Brussels.",I can't think of anything negative about this hotel.,10
2554,Art de Sejour - B&B,"Mario, was the perfect host.  Our jobs are extremely stressful and we just totally relaxed in this special place .  The room was luxurious,  we were greeted every morning with an amazing breakfast where Mario even got to know our preferences. Everything about the surroundings  made you realise how much thought were put into the details- just check out that beautiful red door.  Breakfast started with a surprise smoothie every day! We were centrally located - to your  left - just a hop skip and a jump and your at the centre of the city and to your right just a few steps to the subway.  What a perfect way to start our trip in Belgium. ITS THE ONLY PLACE TO BE IN BRUSSELS.",We travel a lot and really we couldn't find anything.. it was just amazing,10

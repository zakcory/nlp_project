2009,Art de Sejour - B&B,Everything was great,"The only thing to slightly let it down was the selection of breads at breakfast as they were rather hard, we would have liked some softer rolls or a toast option, but this would not stop us returning.",9
1843,Art de Sejour - B&B,"Mario was an incredibly thoughtful, hospitable and welcoming host. He takes incredibly good care to make sure that you are comfortable and has your needs met, while also going above and beyond making sure that hygiene and health standards are kept during these Covid-19 times for the health and safety of everyone staying there. The rooms were spotlessly clean, incredibly comfortable, and the location is perfect - short walking distance to the city centre and many other points of interest, while also quiet enough for a good nights sleep.  Public parking is also conveniently located across the street, which was great for us since we travelled by car. If you're looking for a clean, comfortable, hospitable stay while in Brussels I couldn't recommend Art de Sejour enough",,10
2211,Art de Sejour - B&B,"Mario aims to spoil his guests and certainly succeeds! Our room was gorgeous, extremely clean and so so comfortable.  Wonderful bathroom.  Bed/pillows/linens were very comfortable and high quality.  Fabulous breakfast is personally made for each guest. Great location/minutes to Grande Place. Train station at the corner.  One word sums it up...PERFECTION!",,10
2111,Art de Sejour - B&B,Awesome place and owner was very accommodating due to arriving a little later and leaving super early. The room was spectacular and we appreciated the owner sitting down with us to give highlights of the city. The to-go breakfast was a really nice touch due to us having to arrive at airport by 7:30 AM.,"Overall, really amazing property.",10
2578,Art de Sejour - B&B,"Everything was great. We loved our one night, and wished we had been able to stay a bit longer. (AND..Mario gave us some fixtures and kitchen appliances input on our upcoming remodel). Thank you!",,10
1919,Art de Sejour - B&B,"A beautiful property well situated for walking around the city. Beautiful decor, with an artistic blend of old and new. The facilities were of a high standard and could not fault a thing. Our room was large and even had a dressing area, tea and coffee maker, fridge with complimentary drinks. Bathroom was modern with a walk in shower and toiletries and the towels and dressing gowns smelt divine!! Mario was a wonderful host and spent time explaining where to visit in and around the city and the places to avoid! We are so pleased we chose to stay there!! ",The area outside is undergoing renovations but out of host control. Long term only a good thing for his business.,9.6
1902,Art de Sejour - B&B,"The property was perfectly located, with all of Brussels main tourist sights no more than a 15 minute walk away. The room was spacious and the shower was amazing with a large and comfortable double bed. Mario is a simply amazing host, offering you a range of breakfasts each morning, an all inclusive mini bar in the room and giving you a map, talking you through the must see sights and where ""tourist traps"" are located! Two nights just wasn't enough, we shall be returning soon !",,10

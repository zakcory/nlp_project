Unfortunately there was an unusually loud party going on late in the night by the neighbours. No fault of the owners, but it messed with my sleep. Great beds also.","Loud neighbours. Didn't like that, but not owners fault.",8.8
17832,B&B Pastorie van Merkem,"Breakfast was fantastic as with out previous stay. Outside in the garden with home picked fruits, home made yoghurt, fresh eggs from their own hens and honey from their bees. The best breakfast we have had in a bed and breakfast and is our standard to beat. Rooms very comfortable and as it hit 40 degrees on our visit the air conditioning in the bedroom was fantastic.",nothing,10

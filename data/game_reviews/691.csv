23278,Hotel Continental Gare du Midi,We did not like ANYTHING at this hotel,This hotel was horrifically  horrid. It was a building site outside and couldn't get to the front door. There was rowdy low company outside the hotel. Inside was something from the 1980s and dirty and smelly and rank. The room was dated and dirty. We had no toilet roll. When we left in the morning the sidewalk was awash with  maggots from the bins. I would definitely recommend NOT staying here. Find somewhere else please.,2.5

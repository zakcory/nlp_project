103,B&B Place Jourdan,"An incredibly cosy place really close to the European Quarter (where cosy accommodation is very hard to get). Everything has a friendly, colourful and human touch to it while it still remains trendy and clean. The owners are extremely lovely and nothing's ever a problem for them. The room had everything I could possibly need and was very peaceful.  The breakfast was always a highlight of my day  beautifully presented, with so many great healthy and not-so-healthy options, combining organic and locally produced goodies with Belgian classics. This was my second time in B&B Place Jourdan and I hope to come back again.",Everything was great.,10

212,B&B Place Jourdan,"I really like the location, close to Jourdan (cool bars and places to eat) and also close to the EU district, which was great for me, because I was travelling for work.  The owners were nice, very kind.  The breakfast was great! Offered in a very speical way as well :) Comfy bed.","My room was quite dusty, so it didn't feel very clean. It was a very sunny day when I arrived and when I sat on the bed a cloud of dust went up. The stairs to the top floors are very narrow and steep. Which is fine but a bit inconvenient when carrying a suitcase.",7.9
254,B&B Place Jourdan,The bed was very comfortable and large and the room spacious and very clean. The breakfast was also great because the owner brings fresh bred and croissants every morning.,"The area to have breakfast is really small so if there are more people who want to have breakfast at the same time, it might be a little bit crowded: there are only two small tables.",10

6644,Golden Tree Hotel,This is a nice a friendly hotel that I always look to book when visiting Brugge. The hotel isn't large but makes up for it with the location. The hotel does not have a bar but being in the centre it is within a few meters of the city centre so it doesn't need one. There is plenty of choice for breakfast and I particularly enjoyed the fresh pancake machine.,,9.2

7394,Golden Tree Hotel,Location,The room had a terrible smell of drains and the air conditioning did not work. We reported this to the receptionist. She said it was the first they had had this reported. However after reading reviews from this hotel it appears that you're a few customers had complained. It was a known problem for the hotel. We were only offered a glass of fizz to say sorry as they could not move us. Our room smelt badly we had to sleep with the window open on a ground floor which was very noisy. Our room was in an annex away from the hotel. The air conditioning did not work. We had a very unpleasant stay and would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I believe a glass of fizz was a pathetic apology.,4.6

427,Antwerp Harbour Hotel,clean room and clean bathroom,too hot in the room some noisy outside in the city,7.1
576,Antwerp Harbour Hotel,"Breakfast was nice and the hotel was clean. You can make free coffee, tea the whole day in the lobby bar. The tram/bus station is in front of the hotel which is very convenient.",The hotel is not close to the center and the road to the hotel is auwful. I think it is in an industrial area of the city so it is definately a very bad choice if you want to walk to the city center.  The hotel outside is very old and ugly so it`s a very poor quaility for the money spent. I will never book it again and don`t recomment it.,2.9
672,Antwerp Harbour Hotel,The staff were truly personable and very helpful.  The breakfast was the best!,The distance from the center city was greater than we expected.,9.2

609,Antwerp Harbour Hotel,"Good very clean hotel and excellent value for money. Prime location if you have business at the port or the businesses there - don't book it if you want the centre of town. There is free parking in front of the hotel too. I had a room at the back and it was quiet. It is not a flash hotel, but it doesn't need to be. Tram & bus stop outside the hotel.","Getting to the hotel from the main road (it's in a cul-de-sac visible from the main road, but you have to drive around the houses to get to it).",9.6
244,Antwerp Harbour Hotel,,"The overal cleaniness was only average. the bathroom was in general clean, but the sink was stained, despite seemingly refurbished recently. The carpet also had dark stains behind the bed towards the window. The carpet tiles are easy to remove, so I wonder why this is not done?",8

4423,Hotel Boterhuis,The location is great. Very friendly und helpful staff. The breakfast was very good.,"The room was very, very, very different from the picture on the web page. Small, old, with old furniture. The bed is without a table, directly on the wall, very uncomfortable, only 2 pillows, also uncomfortable. Bed linen didn't smell fresh, were old, frayed and worn with stains. The terrace was dirty. Wi- fi was slow. Draining from the shower was slow. No hangers in the bathroom. No mini fridge in the room. I can't recommend!!!",4.6

4781,Hotel Du Parlement,"Basically, this is a typical 'previous-century' Brussels house in which individuals rooms have been converted to guest rooms. Price/quality is OK and probably one of the most fair in the district (where most hotel guests are not paying their own bills but using European tax money to pay much higher prices for rooms that are not much better). I have stayed in multiple hotels in this districts, single nights at the time, and this hotel is just fine. What you see in the website description is what you get. And no, there is no elevator..",Nothing. Read all the booking.com comments and you have a good idea of what to expect.,7

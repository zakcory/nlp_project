14635,EXIT 29,"Staff are friendly.  It is not like a regular hotel since it is in a truck parking and the costumers are almost truck drivers so it is different environment, but not everyone would like this",There was bad smell in room section. Staff do not know English. Also it is exactly located at the heart of a crowded truck parking so you should consider this too,6.7
14687,EXIT 29,Nothing,"never seen a worse hotel. the staff only spoke french, there is no wifi in the rooms, the room was freezing cold and really dirty, the dinner and breakfast were disgusting, the reception was also the restaurant cashier so if there are customers eating you have to wait. really not recommended",1

9549,Condo Gardens Leuven,,"Overal OK, but don't expect much. 
Have you ever seen a check-in Tim set at 16 o'clock? For me this is the first time. With quite an early checkout at 10. I guess cleaning a room takes 6 hours? 
Check-in and checkout times left me 2 of three days on the street. Despite having requested somewhat later check-in and somewhat earlier checkout while booking, they said they would try. However, on the ground, employees just don't do any effort to be helpful except from apllying their unnecessarily strict rules. ",6.7

4056,Hotel Boterhuis,"Breakfast was delicious, with a continental spread offered and hosts cooking eggs scrambled, fried or boiled.  Room was a very good size, as was the bathroom which was very modern and clean. We had the window open all night and didn't hear a thing other than the church bells in the distance. This was a pleasant surprise to us as the hotel is literally a 2 minute walk to the main centre.  Parking is available in a nearby underground private carpark that is accessible at all times during your stay","Loved the hotel, Loved the city, Loved the people!! The only thing we didn't like was that we had to leave so soon :(",10

The ventilation ran all night which was rather noisy and we could hear other rooms partying through it. Room didn't heat up very well. Could have been a defect in our room only though.,6.3

Small room, in my opinion proper for 1 person.","I stayed for 3 nights and on the 2nd day nobody went to clean the room. Because I just arrived at the hotel about midnight and tired I did not say anything at the reception. The hotel needs to invest in pillows, the ones I had were really bad.",6.7

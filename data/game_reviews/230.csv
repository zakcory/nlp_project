The room was very spacious and clean.","I can't think of one thing to dislike!  My only recommendation would be for anyone not able to manage stairs, to request a lower level room.",9.6
19989,B&B La Porte Cochere,"Extremely friendly hosts, there was no need to visit tourist information as Steven provided maps and suggestions of what to see in the time available.  Location is fantastic, very close to town square.  Breakfast was actually far more than we could eat.  As the weather was so warm a fridge was stocked with bottled water in the hall.  Lovely terrace to sit out in the evening.  Only possible improvement would be small fridges in the rooms to keep any drinks or food purchased cold. ",,9.2

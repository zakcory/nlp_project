17255,ibis De Panne,Location.,No hand towels in room. No kettle or tea/coffee making facilities. Cost of tea/coffee at reception was too much. Breakfast was poor - no cereal other than granola. Only scrambled eggs or boiled eggs were the hot options. No staff around to clean crumbs from tables & chairs or restock food. Cost of parking too much ($20 a night is expensive).,4

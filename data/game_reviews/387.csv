2207,CITYSTAY,"The property was very centrally located .  Our host Tobias was very helpful and accommodating. 
A few minor changes would make this accommodation perfect. 
The pillows are terrible ! Needs softer pillows. A mini fridge would be very useful. Otherwise we would have no hesitation about staying here again",,9.2
2146,CITYSTAY,Very nice room close to the city center. All the main attractions can be reached on foot.,"To me it was a bit strange to never see a host or even other people living at the hotel. Maybe I should have done more research before booking, but I was definitely not expecting this. Apart from this giving me kind of a weird impression, everything worked out fine: the code I got for the main door and room worked well and the room was decorated in chic nordic design. ",8.3

1961,CITYSTAY,"Very nice and spacious room, comfortable big bed and washroom with a great shower. No TV, but plenty of magazines to kill the boring moments. Perfect position in a quite area few steps from the historic city centre. Acces via code instead of keys works very well and you don't need to worry about losing them! We followed the suggestion of the host to have breakfast at the Cafe Mundi and it was excellent.","Room doors are quite noisy so if other guests have very different schedules than yours, it might be an issue. We could ear the music from the next room, luckily it was of our taste and not too loud neither till late, but again, that might be an issue.",9

9968,ATW Apartments,Location was perfect if you are based in Central Antwerp - 2 minutes walk from the nearest Metro (Astrid) and the bars & restaurants and 5 mins to the main station. We were based at the apartment for an event at the Sportpaleis which was a 25 minute walk or 5 mins on the Metro. Balcony was a nice added feature!,,9.2
9990,ATW Apartments,"Location excellent, just a short walk from the railway station. Good sized apartment.",Would really have liked bedside lamps.,9.2
9866,ATW Apartments,"Kitchen facilities were good. Induction stove and oven were functioning well.
 
Two beds one in the common room like a studio and other bed is in a separate room. Good place centrally located near train station if you are with kids. Not very posh but convenient.","Construction ongoing outside the apartment. Was quite noisy due to poor sound isolation. Located above a shisha bar and snooker/pool bar. So people were a bit noisy during the night or early morning.
Although check-in is allowed from 14.00 hrs, the apartment was not cleaned and ready. We were asked to come back in 30 mins.
Need to call the number on the front door to open the door. There is a bell but probably it is broken.
Bathroom shower is a bit small but otherwise everything is ok.",7.9
9956,ATW Apartments,"Location was great - it was very close to the shopping area and central station (a little far from sightseeing - about 25 minute walk). Host was responsive, even though he didn't speak English.","It wasn't kids safe. Furniture seemed flimsy, and plugging in teapot shut off the power circuit in the entire apartment. We never received a replacement pot and there were no pots to boil water in. Also, we were afraid to plug in anything into power outlets after that.",6.7
9806,ATW Apartments,,Invoice missing so i left without having an invoice cause nobody at reception at 08:30,7
9840,ATW Apartments,"All though the host didn¬¥t speak English, he tried his best to make us understand him and was very friendly upon arrival.  The appartment was very good, certainly for what we paid. Awesome location, yes there was a strip club next to the apartment but we didn¬¥t really experience any inconvience from it, except a bit from the music at night. Good apartment to enjoy a city trip in Antwerpen for a small budget!",,7.9
9827,ATW Apartments,The apartment was clean n kitchen facilities were fully available. Also very roomy with more than enough space for us and we had everything we needed.,,7.5

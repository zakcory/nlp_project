23785,Best Western Plus Park Hotel Brussels,,"At check-in they requested my ID-card, and they forgot to give it back to me. Even at checkout, they did not give it back, it was only because I was an other hotel the night after and I realised that my ID-card was gone ..  At check-in they did not tell me that breakfast was NOT included. If I had known, I would not have taken breakfast. Because at checkin I had to pay for it. Unnecessary. Bad communication at check-in.",7

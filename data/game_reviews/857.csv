15017,ibis Gent Centrum St. Baafs Kathedraal,The staff was super nice accomodating our requests for additional pillows/sheets. Beautiful view from our 5th floor room on Gent's roofs and cathedrals!,Room was a little too hot; definitely too warm for the provided comforter. Bathroom is tiny!,7
15120,ibis Gent Centrum St. Baafs Kathedraal,"The staff was amazingly kind and generous. We went in a period were the covid restrictions were very limited and we still managed to have our breakfast at our room. Also, the underground parking is a plus.","We took a premium room because of the bath, but in the end the bath was so tiny that a grown up could not enjoy it.  We had a nice view of the church, but combined with a tram passing just next to our window. ",7

16556,ibis Gent Centrum St. Baafs Kathedraal,Amazing position,"The room was EXTRIMELY small.
I was told my room would not have been cleaned due to Covid-19 restrictions. To get a clean room, I would have had to change the room and I could do that as many times as I wanted. This also applies to towels and toilet paper. However, after three days I asked to change my room and then they just sent the cleaning service. It seems only a cheap excuse not to clean the room. Moreover, the breakfast buffet could be considered way more dangerous, since people are touching food and stuff.",6

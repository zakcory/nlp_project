1556,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,Very clean,"It was good, except the room was with a closed street view and the windows were not sound proof so it was noisy and we couldn't really sleep late, we had to wake up early.",7
1649,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"The location is probably the best in Bruges. Our room was EUR 150 and we had a beautiful view. Breakfast was painful however. Despite Corona rules everyone arrived at breakfast at the same time and one member of staff was 'policing' all the food. She was borderline rude and disorganised but you could tell that she thought that she was doing a great job. The food itself was very uninspired, but that is typical of Bruges. From a culinary point of view, Bruges is pathetic. still serving the same crap as in the 70s, 80s, 90s.. The town however is so delightful that most of the time one doesn't really care. And the beer is always good of course.",see above,7

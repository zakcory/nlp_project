1765,Guesthouse Bernardin,"First of all the lady at the checkin is a charm. Made us feel welcomed and refreshed. Secondly, the location of the property is very apt. Right next to it is the Sint-Jacobs tram station, as well as the Meir shopping district. Lastly, the property is very nicely maintained. It is built inside a 17th or 18th century church, but the interiors are very well done with a mix of ancient stone and modern gloss finish. Very comfortable and made me feel close to European culture.","Not that it mattered much but in a duplex arrangement, perhaps you could put wet points on both floors. Had to run to the bathroom upstairs each time we wanted to fill the cup of water.",9.6
1604,Guesthouse Bernardin,We were greeted by the super friendly and helpful Stephanie. The room was warm and comfortable. The property is in a great location.,No running water near the kitchen,9.2
1803,Guesthouse Bernardin,"The guesthouse is very relaxing and charming. The bed was incredibly soft and comfortable. If you are nervous of heights, the stairs are quite steep and slippery in socks to the bedroom - I would recommend for the owners to put down some sort of gripped material on the steps. Also, you have to be careful to not get water all over the bathroom with the shower head.",Communication with staff for arrival time could be better.,7.1
1624,Guesthouse Bernardin,,The stair up to the bedroom is pretty steep.,8.3
1744,Guesthouse Bernardin,"I liked the location, it is very quiet and still right in the center of Antwerp. The hosts were very friendly. I would use this place again. Thank you.",,9.6

7395,Appartement Moliere,Spacious rooms that were well furnished. Everything was very clean and peaceful location outside the main city but with good transport availability.,"No sink with the toilet and shower/bath was difficult to use. There were also no curtains or netting in the bathroom. This is fine but it should have been clearer when booking. Although there is parking, it is only for 2 hours before you have to change the parking permit so not very practical if away. Although we did feel secure, there was possible access into the locked rooms via lift. ",8.3

4411,Alpha Hotel,Location was great and the fact we could check in sooner made our trip a lot more pleasant. Place was tidy.,"The mattress was a bit too hard to my liking and the pillows a bit flat, but that is of course a personal preference.  This might as well differ between the rooms.",6
4392,Alpha Hotel,Gentleman on reception was courteous and helpful. Close to beach and right in the town.,"The lady on reception was rude, struggled for any English channels on TV.",7
4668,Alpha Hotel,"Positive: good location, friendly staff at the reception, clean.","Negative: tiny room with no daylight (almost all rooms have windows to a small and dark courtyard which is filled with the fire escape stairs), two out of three nights the toilet was broken (I told them after the first night and someone came to fix it, but it broke again), very noisy (you hear everything from the hallway and neighbouring rooms), run-down furniture and old, uncomfortable mattresses.",5.4

4375,Alpha Hotel,The staff and the location. Perfect.,It was so hot to sleep.,8
4547,Alpha Hotel,"Great localization, it was really close to the sea, shops, restaurants. Check-in and check-out process was fast and without any problem, the staff is professional. From my window, I can go to something like fire escape stairs which was really awesome, this is the biggest advantage of this place.","In my room, I don't have wifi connection. It was the biggest disadvantage, the second one room was placed at the end of the very, very long corridor when I reached the end I was a little bit tired :P Elevator is a little bit frightening",7
4615,Alpha Hotel,"It is well located, properly equipped and clean! I think it is good enough for the price paid! ",,7.5

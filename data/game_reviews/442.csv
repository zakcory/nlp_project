A lot of parking spaces available.","We have booked a twin room, but on arrival we have received a twin room but the beds where put together and only one sheet was placed on both of them. We couldn't separate it completely to feel comfy. I have pointed out that there will be 2 male colleagues travelling, but probably they didn't take this into consideration. Very expensive breakfast. Room was tiny.",8.3

Even on a rainy, cold day we could enjoy the heated pool and the sauna, and the kids could choose from the many board games offered by the domain. 
All Corona- related measures are in place, I felt secure during our stay. ","The location of our room was not ideal, next to the staff's room, who started the day early and were a bit noisy. ",9

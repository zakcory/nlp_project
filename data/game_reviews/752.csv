16859,Hotel Koffieboontje,"The location is one of the best in the city, just some meters from the Markt square. The room was good but a bit small for 3 person, in the other hand the small terrace was great for our dog and take relax moments on it. It has one small kitchen just to prepare basic food but good enough.","The size of the room was too small for 2 beds and 3 persons, the noise of the bar just down of our room was also uncomfortable.",8
17591,Hotel Koffieboontje,Excellent location!!! Great restaurant on the property and decent breakfast.,Incredibly small room and bathroom with a very uncomfortable sinking bed. No real mattress! Main room lighting didn't work so it was very dark.,6.3
17751,Hotel Koffieboontje,Good location,The rooms aren't very spacey and somewhat old,7.1
17501,Hotel Koffieboontje,"The size of the quadruple suite was good for us, plenty of space and facility to make food in the suite. Washing up liquid provided (as rule is to wash all crockery becore leaving), shower was powerful. Location is AMAZING! Staff were all friendly and helpful.","The large bed was just 2 beds pushed together but not secured, and they kept moving apart- sleep was not comfortable because of this. The room requires a bit of freshening up of the decor, the room is clean but looks a little grubby. Breakfast was basic, but OK",7.1

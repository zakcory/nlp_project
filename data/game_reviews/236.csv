5753,B&B Le flaneur,"I thought this was a lovely cosy place, full of personal touches and interesting little collections of quirky things..including a working gramophone! Ours hosts/the owners gave us a very warm welcome and were very helpful.. and their beautiful little dog was great too :) Breakfast was great, lots of homemade things and very filling. Don't forget to have a game of table football before you leave..",,10
5676,B&B Le flaneur,"Le Flaneur is a delightful B&B - it is beautifully kept and displays an eclectic collection of vintage and antique objects. The hosts, Erika and Dietrich, are warm and welcoming and could not have been more helpful. The  breakfast is outstanding - Erika makes something extra every morning, so we had French toast one day and a quiche the next.  We will definitely be returning.",,10

5739,B&B Le flaneur,"Every morning the hosts had a new creation for breakfast (sometimes something sweet, then something with eggs etc.). This made the breakfast very tasty and special. Furthermore the hosts were super friendly and helpful. We had a cozy room under the roof and felt super comfortable. Straight recommendation!",,10

5623,B&B Le flaneur,"We had a pleasant stay in this charming real Brugge-spirit B&B! It's located in an old typical house, just outside the busy city center, calm and nice neighbourhood. We liked a lot the hospitality of the owners (including the cutest doggy who loves to play and a cat). 
The breakfast was really good! Fresh juice, good quality local bread rolls (pistolet), warm eggs, salmon (I don't like meat so really appreciate that), a homemade delicious dessert, etc! Yes, you have to eat it in a room (covid.), but it's more than enough! ","As it's a typical old house, to keep in mind that it's not entirely soundproof, including a toilet in a room, however, we had no problem with that at all! ",10

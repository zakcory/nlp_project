15708,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,"I think this place has got everything you need to just chill/relax and leave your day to day tensions behind.
Loved it and will be back in near future ",Just the problem with the stroller of our new born. There were some stairs to get to our room. And the floor made a lot of crackling noise when we walked and baby's sleep was disturbed.,9
16269,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,"The hotel staff were all great and v helpful. We liked the furnishings, smart, relaxed without being stuffy or pretentious.","The only downside, unfortunately was in the dining room the cheese board was left unprotected from the flies landing on all the lovely cheeses. 
Perhaps a little note to remind guests to replace the cover after use would be a nice touch.",10
15693,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,We liked the view and the BBQ they arranged due to covid restrictions. The pool and that whole area was great and there's a lot of great hiking trips you can do in the area. The staff was very helpful and friendly.,"The breakfast was a bit basic.
The last night of our stay, the restaurant reopened after being closed for several months due to covid and the evening was a bit of an unorganized chaos. We understand that it was all new and weren't too upset but we really hope for future guests that they'll get better organized",9
16130,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,Location perfection !,"Misleading pictures on the site about how the rooms are.. i paid for a superior room but at the check in i got a another room different from the picture, and the crazy and vague explanation from the staff was that the picture was a presentation of the best room and the rooms on the pictures were all reserved, so what i got was still a good room but very different from the picture. That was a shame!! ",6.7

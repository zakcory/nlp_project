20808,Hotel Corner House,I liked de comfort of the extra bed for my kid.,"I missed a good shower, our room the shower was not working good, we had to wait for hours to fill the bath with a little bit of water with the right temperature inorde to take a shower or a douch. And the breakfast was always the same dish no change.",8.8
20774,Hotel Corner House,The breakfast provided a good choice. The lady at reception was very friendly and helpful.,The breakfast area was busy and a little congested based on the small room used for the buffet style b'fast and the access to it. The method of cooking boiled eggs was not effective. I put my eggs in for 15 minutes and they were still uncooked after this time and had to be thrown away.,7.5
20757,Hotel Corner House,"Lovely choice at breakfast Beds were really comfortable and they were able to provide a travel cot and bedding at very short notice, late at night on a saturday. It was much appreciated!",We had thought there was parking on site and it was difficult to carry two very tired children at 10pm to the hotel through the town from the main town centre car park. That was a hassle.,8.3
20791,Hotel Corner House,"Pleasant check in experience with a nice lady. Nice, big, refurbished room with view of the sea. We seem to have been put in a room a bit removed from others because we were travelling with a baby so that was nice and made it less stressful for us.","Mould on the wall of a recently refurbished room (?). Room difficult to access with a buggy. Very unpleasant staff member at the breakfast. Snapped at my partner for our room number and generally gave off terrible, stress and bad energy as she stomped around the restaurant. Also the buffet breakfast area is too cramped.",6.7
20852,Hotel Corner House,once found bearings - convenient location,Unmade bed with cleaning cloth on unchanged sheets  Given an alternative room with clean beds Apology given albeit reluctantly Very poor for car parking,6
20838,Hotel Corner House,Breakfast buffet was good and plenty on it. Fresh squeezed orange juice! Once the Hotel is fully booked it gets really crowded in the restaurant for breakfast especially in the buffet section since its not very big. Bed was really comfy. Hotel is clean.,,9.6
20823,Hotel Corner House,Nice bathroom,"We got given a room that looked onto an internal fire escape.  There was noise from an air con unit all night. A fight outside our bedroom at 3-4am which apparently is okay for hotels! Got passed round 3 staff in the morning when I tried to complain about broken sleep and my daughter being upset by the screaming.  Told to wait over 2 hours for the owner, but had to be out of room in 1!  It was awful.  ",3.8

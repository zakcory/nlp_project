15488,Center Parcs Vossemeren,"Pool is great, location/setting is lovely ","We were turned away by 2 restaurants as they said they were closed while they were still both half full of people
We were thus forced to eat in the restaurant where the entertainment was on. It was way too loud, even when sitting in the back. 
Rooms was very old, clean but scruffy because of the fittings",6.3
15377,Center Parcs Vossemeren,,Tried to change dates over a month before. Accommodation available but Center Parcs totally inflexible. Booking.com also inflexible. Both companies blaming each other for not being able to change booking. Feel like we'd been scammed. Not using either ever again.,1
15307,Center Parcs Vossemeren,Amazing facilities and caters for all ages as we had a 7 year old and a 70 year old in our party! The activities were easy to book on the day and the aquamundo and discovery bay were fantastic.,The patio area was overgrown and it wasn't particularly pleasant to sit out.,8.8

15360,Center Parcs Vossemeren,I liked the location and the access to many different activities. The cottage was also spacious. The staff was very friendly. The water park and discovery park were awesome and my toddler really enjoyed herself. Us parents also enjoyed all the activities.,"The food at all of the restaurants was not the best. Some of the extra activities were too expensive, considering the price that was already paid to stay. The cottage also got very hot on some days and because there are no screens in the windows we could not just leave the windows open to get some air.",7.5
15503,Center Parcs Vossemeren,"The room was spacious with a balcony to enjoy a coffee in morning overlooking the lake. Spacious double sink bathroom which was very clean. I loved the fact that we had a mini fridge in the room. Close to the swimming pool (market dome), fabulous breakfast with lots to choose from.",Even though we had a fridge in the room it did not work properly. So drinks weren't kept cold. In my father in laws room the fridge however did work.,9.2

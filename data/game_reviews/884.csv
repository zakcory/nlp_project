19376,Jam Hotel,The decor is cool.  The restaurant looks nice albeit pricey and the rooftop bar area is great.,"The lift is tiny, struggled to fit two people with luggage.  No air-conditioning in the rooms made the stay really uncomfortable during the heat wave.  The small desk fan really didn't help.  The hallways have a slight hostel feel. It's about 10-15 minutes to the city centre, so not super convenient, had to take Uber or public transport.",5

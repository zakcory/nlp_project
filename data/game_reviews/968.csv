25417,Sauveniere 1,Perfect location.  Great terrace. The kitchen was well equipped. I really like the humble and cozy decoration of the place. It was clean and big.,"The rooms were really cold, I think the house bigger than it gets heat. ( Also we stayed while the bars/shops were closed because of Covid. I think that in ""normal"" times, there would be so much noise.)",9
25469,Sauveniere 1,Lovely top floor apt with large balcony and views over the city.  Two comfortable bedrooms and well-equipped kitchen.,No kettle!  Very small toilet - strange that ensuite bathrooms did not include toilets.  Unfortunately very loud music playing all night - don't know if that happens every night!  No dedicated parking.,8.3
25443,Sauveniere 1,"We were very surprised with the apartment. It's very big and very well decorated and taken care of. It was great to have 2 bedrooms each with a bathroom and a large terrace with excellent views. The location made it easy after spending the day in the city. Next to all good restaurants and stores and walking distance from all the major attractions. We parked in an indoor garage opposite for 24 hours for $20.
Great that the owner allows pets too! 
Very comfortable and nice beds. ","Given the location next to busy Le Carre which we knew in advance, there are a large number of bar/clubs behind the building which all play extremely loud music until 5am. We knew this in advance and so brought ear plugs to sleep (recommended!) but apart from that all good! ",8.8
25521,Sauveniere 1,"The apartment was very spacious, clean, and well-equipped. Central location--albeit a bit sketchy on a Saturday night--near bakeries and restaurants.","We maybe just had bad luck..but there was obviously a party in the building the night we stayed. The smell of smoke and noise made sleeping nearly impossible until after 4AM. The apartment was well cared for, but the building was not well maintained in the common area.",6.5
25456,Sauveniere 1,"Apartment size offers excellent value for money - it has a spacious main bedroom with an en suite and a spacious lounge/dining area. Our host was welcoming and made sure everything was understood despite us speaking different languages. The property is located in an area close to shops, bars & restaurants as well as bus routes.",It would be better if the windows were thicker glazed to reduce noise from the busy road that the property is located on. There was also noise from a party nearby on the first night we stopped and a window at the main entrance was broken.,7.9
25534,Sauveniere 1,"Big apartment, great price (probably because of COVID), good location in the center with supermarkets and restaurants nearby","Nonfriendly and nonhelpful host, 5th floor and small old-style elevator, 2 beds are quite small and moving at night, nearby parking is quite expensive and costs 20,5 eur/24 hours.",8
25508,Sauveniere 1,The apartment was very spacious.  Central location.   Two blocks to the parking garage.,"There were only 2 sets of towels even though I specifically booked for 3 people.  The couch is very old and uncomfortable.  There were a few broken windows.  Being on the top floor, it got very hot and had to open the windows and doors, but it sits on  a busy street and it became too noisy to sleep with the windows open.  There are two bathrooms with showers but no toilets.  Only 1 toilet.  So the listing is a bit misleading.",6

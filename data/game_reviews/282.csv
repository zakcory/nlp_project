13744,B&B The Good House,"Beautiful, huge room/suite with jacuzzi in the bathroom. The bed was big en very comfortable. The neighbourhood has many many restaurants to take-away food (and have dinner in regular times, I suspect) and in the shared kitchen there are glasses/cutlery etc. The TV had Netflix, which was nice as well. Good breakfast as well, especially seeing that they had to organise it just for us.","We were the only guests (COVID!) but I suspect the building may be a bit noisy (creaky floors etc) when other guests are there. This would personally not bother me, but might be good to know if you are a light sleeper.",9
13759,B&B The Good House,"Perfect place to stay, feels very much at home, hope to stay again. Spacious, beautiful details, comfortable, very friendly. Beautiful shared space and kitchen on the ground floor.",,10

13849,B&B The Good House,"Although we visited B&B The Good House during the covid period, the staff was super friendly and did everything so we could still enjoy our stay as much as possible.",,9
13806,B&B The Good House,Big room with a big comfortable bed and a tv with netflix and amazone prime.,"I only booked this B&B because I was looking for a stay with a whirlpool in the room. There was one in the bathroom but It didn't work so that was really disappointing since that was the only reason to be there. Later I was looking at google reviews and saw someone with the same complaint and this review was from more than 5 months ago and yet, now, 5 months later it was still not working.",6
13835,B&B The Good House,I would have like if no one would have had the next. I think they should try to work on the walls of the rooms. they should try to work on the vicinity of this hotel," it was quite good.. it is really hot at night, when will try to open the window down for some breeze. the mosquitoes were so much we couldn't sleep from the noise of the mosquitoes on our here. the problem I have with this hotel is the rooms, was loud everything that the next lodger was doing I could hear. I couldn't sleep for one night because half the next room beside us the customers was very loud with sex.. the lady was screaming all through the night or throughout the mornings with the loud music as well. that was not comfortable.",7
13790,B&B The Good House,Super luxurious and spacious room! The design and interior are sublime.,Extremely bad isolation and the host was not present during the night. The people that were renting the other room were extremely loud and unrespectful until 2 in the morning.,7

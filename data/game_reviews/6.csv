23680,"1,2,trois..Le Roi",This is the most amazing property. A home from home as very well equipped. Excellent host.,,10
23771,"1,2,trois..Le Roi",The property is clean and in a decent area. We were able to park our minivan on the street and only had to pay $6 per day for parking. The property is located about 1.2 miles from most of the restaurants and shopping so it's a perfect way to eat and still get your exercise in at the end of the day. The owner of the property is extremely friendly and speaks great English.,"The only issue is the steps leading upstairs. They are extremely slippery, especially if you are wearing socks. The steps on the last floor are even more narrow and more slick. If you have kids, they need to be careful walking down. ",8
23689,"1,2,trois..Le Roi","The townhouse is very spacious, comfortable, well equipped and clean. We had a friendly welcome by Sabine and communication before and during our stay was smooth. Parking garage close by the house came in handy. Location between station and city centre is good.
Lots of stairs which could be an issue.",,9.6
23786,"1,2,trois..Le Roi","The property was very well maintained and very clean. It also hade everything you would need such as towels, linen, full kitchen etc etc. Secure parking was very helpful as well.",If I was to pick I would say no ground floor wc.,9.6
23756,"1,2,trois..Le Roi","We loved everything about stay in the townhouse, it really was exceptional. Upon arrival we were greeted by Sabine, who was so welcoming and friendly. She took time to show us around the house which was perfect, very clean and tidy.  Well presented and exactly like the pictures. She was even kind enough to put a welcome pack of food and drinks in the fridge. She showed us how to get to our destination and the best route to take. I cannot recommend staying highly enough, it was a perfect visit and we are hoping to visit again next year.",It couldn't be improved.,10
23726,"1,2,trois..Le Roi","Beautiful modernized traditional Belgian home.  Very clean and well kept.  Only a 10-15 minute walk to the centrum, shopping, and restaurants.  It was a wonderful base to explore Ghent and the surrounding Flanders area (Brugges, Brussels, and Antwerp are all less than an hour away).  Parking is offsite, but only a 3-5 minute walk to a secure garage in a gated enclosure.  Washer and dryer onsite.  The host is very friendly.","Alot of stairs.  Enough stairs that if you left something on the top floor, you really gave some thought about whether it was worth it go up all those stairs to retrieve it.  If you have mobility issues or knee problems, this property might not work well for you.",9.6
23701,"1,2,trois..Le Roi","The house is spacious, luxury and homely at the same time. The top floor is a self-containing apartment with bathroom and toilet. The kids liked Netflix on the TV. Nice main bathroom with bath. Sabine is correct and friendly host, gave us two separate front door keys. The parking place is actually a garage box 5 min walk away, safe and secure, but not very big - if you have a big car, check with Sabine first. It is possible to park for a short time in front of the house (20 min free parking).","The house has 3 floors and the stairs are pretty steep, as often in Belgium. Not a problem for us, but keep in mind if you have walking difficulties.",9.6

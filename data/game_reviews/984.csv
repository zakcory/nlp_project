15705,Smartflats Design - Opera,"Very centrally located. Nice little flat for a short stay.  Shops, restaurants, etc. all within easy walking distance. Proprietors were dealt with remotely but were pretty efficient in responding to queries. Codes instead of keys was quite handy.",Dishwasher was missing (presumably being repaired/replaced?). We could have used a sweeping brush too. A bit overdue for a bit of sprucing up. Some furniture in need of repair/replacement.,7.5
15817,Smartflats Design - Opera,"Location is great, as it is in the centre.","We was let down with the apartment itself. It did not match with the images we had seen on Booking.com. The pictures show a nice apartment, but that's not the case. Furniture on the rooftop broken, broken glasses and chipped mugs in the cupboard, stained sofa, wires everywhere, broken mirror in the bathroom, stained and dirty towels, dirty toilets, empty handsoaps in the bathroom.",3.8

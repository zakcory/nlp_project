25158,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,The room and bathroom were clean.,"The breakfast was poor because there weren't enough tables, and there was a 10-15 minute wait to get in, and then the people were left to deal with it themselves. We were waiting for 20 min for fresh bread. The butter ran out and didn't get replaced.  We also had to make our own bed, why?",6.3

24487,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"Strategic position in front of Central Station, very close to the diamond district. Rooms are OK, but don't expect anything even near luxury","Extenal door was closed at 9,30pm!! Rang the bell several times and nobody was there to open. On the door there is a post with a phone to call and guess what, wrong number (!) Mosquitos in the room Cheap TV set, uneasy to operate",7
25339,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,I've booked a 3 person room and actually got a 4 person room. That was a nice surprise. I've stayed at this hotel before (in 2015) and my experience was the same. Spacious rooms and all the basic facilities you need.,"Rooms are a bit outdated, there are some stains on the carpet and some stains around the bathroom, to be expected from hotels this age. Not a big deal for me, especially at this price point. If the rooms are refurbished they can easily charge more money.",7.5

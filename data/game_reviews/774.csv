10016,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,Great location. Only 35 min by foot to Bruges city. Room was spacious and clean. Nice and friendly staff,There was a slightly smell of cigarette in my room. Not big deal at all as I opened the windows for some fresh air,9.6
9937,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,The outside of the building was beautiful.,The drain in the bathroom sink and shower barley drained. I don't like showering in a pool of water. There were cobwebs and mold in the bathroom.  There was a lot of dust behind the room  door and the main staircase was full of dirt. It looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a while. The place is in need of an overhaul. There were only 2 pillows on the bed and my husband needs two. Couldn't find anyone to give us another. There wasn't one in the closet. Would only give it 3 stars.,3.8
9751,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,"Lovely location 
and a very lovely garden at rear",No coffee or tea facilities in room and very long when theres a function going on down stairs,7.1
9538,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,The location is amazing. The historical palace and the park are just great. Just 10 minutes by car from Bruges city centre.,"We booked a suite but The room was awful. The carpet was full of stains and it was stinking. I am allergic to dust, so you can imagine how bad it was for me. The furniture in the room was very old fashioned and cheap. The only thing nice about the room was the view on the park. Advice to hotel Management: please renovate the rooms ! You have an amazing location, but it is a pity if people have great expectations and then the rooms are blowing everything off. Also, the breakfast was poor and with low quality food. 
The staff was non-existent. We only saw a couple of people in the breakfast room, but for the rest the reception was always empty. ",6
9717,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,"Lovely stay, nice people and well located!",,8.8
9726,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,The room is charmant with the gorgeous view. Its very tidy. The room had a lodge where with cup of coffee in the morning you may find peace and serenity. Close by to the city center (10 min by car); the other bonus from hotel is a free parking on a side.,"The breakfast was quite fine, and even I find it a bit limited in options you still find what to eat.",8

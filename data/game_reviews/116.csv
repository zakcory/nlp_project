5431,Aris Grand Place Hotel,"A beautiful view, polite staff and a great breakfast. Very easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go, in the center of it all, very near Grand Place.","My friends room was very nice and cool, but ours was hot and the AC did not work, we opened the windows which made it plenty cool enough, but the street was so loud at night that it kept us up. That is the only compliant the rest was really amazing. We loved the room so much, we did not report it for fear they would move us and we would lose our perfect view. So we are to blame on  that.",9.2

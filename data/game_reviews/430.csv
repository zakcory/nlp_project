23423,Diamant Suites Brussels EU,Room was big and very comfortable. The hotel close to public transport.,"I have a bad experience with this hotel. I booked Non-refundable room. All other hotels was charged the total price of the reservation. But this hotel didn't. On the second day of our arrival at noon, we found out that they took money from our card and didn't ask us. It was our last money on the card. I was going to pay cash.  Because of that in Amsterdam, we could not book online tickets to several places and had to pay more and wait in the queue. But the worst thing was when we found out that the tickets to the Van Gogh museum can only be buy online. My wife really wanted to enter the museum. There were NO Wi-Fi at all. The carpet was dirty in our room. Far from city center.",6.3
23232,Diamant Suites Brussels EU,"Good location, close to public transport and to the highway. It takes 10-15 minutes to drive to the city center. Excellent parking garage with key code access, cost is 15$ per day. They send you instructions to retrieve the access code to the room, which is quite straightforward - we arrived late at night, which was no problem.  Staff was very friendly and helpful every time we interacted with them. Huge bathtub, albeit very low water pressure - took forever to fill up","The room could have been cleaner. Not that it was outright dirty, but there were several spots in the bathroom that were missed in the cleaning process. The carpet in our room was old and had several stains. The furnishing seemed somewhat dated. In my opinion, the room could use a refurbishing, then it would be perfect.",7.5

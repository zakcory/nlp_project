13386,B&B Sogni d'oro,"Friendly host, very clean bedroom and breakfast area, comfortable bed, private bathroom and continental  breakfast. Parking space on the premise.","Being both 1m80 tall, the bathroom was very uncomfortable for us. We had to walk bended over towards the toilet and could hardly sit upright on it. There was only a bath, no shower (again you could not stand upright but had to sit ) It is a real challenge not to bang your head due to the declining ceiling.",8
13437,B&B Sogni d'oro,"The breakfast was first class. I have Coeliac disease which proved no problem to my hosts who went out of their way to get me gluten free bread. The room was very clean, furnished well with a lovely comfortable bed. I was very much made to feel at home and I will certainly return on my next visit.",,10

13403,B&B Sogni d'oro,Anita was a great host who was able to give us guidance about  getting around the area. The room was clean and pleasant  with a comfortable bed.  Parking at the house was an added bonus. Driving into Ghent from here was not a problem.,The bedroom is on the second floor with a shared shower and sink on that level. The toilet is on the first floor --down several steps. We were fine with this arrangement but if one has difficulty with stairs it may be a challenge.,8.3

5638,Aris Grand Place Hotel,"Clean, nice size tub with hot water, close to restaurants, comfortable beds, lovely front desk personnel.","Noise.we couldnt sleep.there was yelling and partying outside most of the night. The breakfast was mediocre.cold boiled eggs, old soft apples, glueten free buns were frozen in the middle. Taxis couldnt get to the hotel so it was difficult walking up hills on cobblestones. Fortunately we were able to pay a hotel guest to walk with us to the train station and carry our luggage on wheels for us..fortunately it wasnt raining.",7.9

Very clean and nice shower products!

If you are a light sleeper, it could be hard because you can hear what's happening outside (luckily I am not so it really didn't bother me at all).",9

Staff were friendly and the room very clean and comfortable,"On Saturday  I came to the Breakfast area quite late on and I could not find a clean table for breakfast, also some of the food was no longer available. I did complain about this and in fairness they deducted the cost of my breakfast from my room rate. This Monday morning all was good, tables all cleared and plenty of food available",8.8

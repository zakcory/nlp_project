8715,Sputnik Hotel,"The hotel is about 3km away from the railway-station, good to reach either by walking or (better) by bus. The distance to the bus halt is about 200m, very convenient. The personal is very friendly and try to satisfy all wishes.","Our room was on the front side of the hotel, where the main street runs past. And underneath our room was the restaurant, where karaoke played until midnight. It would be no problem, if there were air condition, but if you open the window, it's hard to find sleep. Better look for a room on the back side!",8.8

No ventilation in the toilet. No shower curtain means the bathroom gets flooded. No pan in the kitchen. Wrong internet password was given before arrival.,7

26191,Smartflats City - Royal,Loved the location. Apartment was spacious and the beds were comfortable.  WiFi worked well and the shower part of the bathroom was good.,Furnishings were inadequate because there was only 1 couch and no chairs. The only toilet was in the entrance hall and was very tiny and a person with girth could not use the facilities easily. 52 steps is way more than two flights of step. Pillows were not comfortable. There was no place in the smaller bedroom to put your luggage. It would have been nice to have more than one towel per person when staying for three days. It would be nice to have had paper towels and Kleenex.,6.7

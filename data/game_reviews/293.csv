8732,Beijing Hotel Minsk,Room size- one of the biggest what you will find in Minsk. Good location. Good SPA area.,"Payment- attention to other travelers!!! Conformation received from booking.com you get in USD!!! On arrival when you make check in personal says you must pay in BY Rubles and then the funny thing is that they have their own exchange rate and you end up paying extra when you look on your bank account. No complain if would receive conformation in BY rubles, or explanation in conformation that you will need to pay in BY Rubles, but this small thing disappoint the impression about honesty of hotel.",7.5

8923,Beijing Hotel Minsk,"very good breakfast, amazing room",there was a separation between men and women at the spa. i have been told because it's a Chinese hotel. but i was a lot of times in China and there there is no separation,8.8
8509,Beijing Hotel Minsk,"This place is really what it says it is. You book you pay, you enjoy. It's as simple as that! 
Good food, fantastic staff, extremely helpful and kind. The location is actually really good, it's not in the busy centre which I actually liked about it. But having said that, it isn't far from the main high street, walking distance I would say. 
Due to pandemic of COVID 19 there were very few people in the hotel, which I kinda liked too :) 
All and all great experience! 
Enjoy ;) ",,9
8648,Beijing Hotel Minsk,"The room is very comfortable (very similar for 5* hotels in China). Staff - very helpful, I've got very quick responses from them for all my questions. Location - that is only 5* hotel in that district (not far from main industrial area), very pleasant, n","Chinese restaurant in the hotel and breakfast. Both - below my expectations and only because of food. Meals quality is average (If you've ever been in China - not comparable), low value for money you have to pay.   Small parking for guests.",8.8

8612,Hotel Boomgaard,"One of the best small hotels I have ever stayed at. Great hosting, clean, spacious room, good breakfast, quiet setting, adequate parking and only 15 minute drive into Maastricht town centre. Also some good restaurants within easy walking distance.

The WiFi experience is good.
The breakfast was well prepared.
You do get a lounge in the shade of your terrace. ","The hotel doesn't have an air conditioning on the room, it's very manageable.
The coffee is alright, but might be bitter for some. ",9

8552,Hotel Boomgaard,"Very quiet room, quiet hotel in general. Perfect for us traveling with a 2-month-old baby and a 2 and a half old boy. Fabienne was always available and friendly. The village is cute, clean and nice to stroll around. Many restaurant options. We recommend Het oude gerechtshof in the village, and Pizzeria Al Mulino just 1,5km from the hotel through the countryside.",,9

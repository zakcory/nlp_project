2797,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"The location of the hotel was good, only a few minutes walk from the market square and all the other amenities. The staff were friendly and the hotel was clean throughout.","There were too many levels in some of the rooms, with step ups and downs, and there was a lack of light switches near the beds, in my instance you had to get out of bed to turn off the light above the bed, the door into the bathroom didn't quite open fully, and was a little bit difficult to shut properly.",6
1707,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,Loved the traditional yet modern vibe to the hotel,,8
2720,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,,The pictures on booking.com did not relate to the hotel as I explained to the staff I felt it was false advertising. I changed from a different hotel to this one based on the photographs. I would recommend it to be removed from the site .,1
3393,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,Old and interesting,"The hotel was fine we were only there for two nights 
So no real mod cons but the building is old an beautiful with great views so makes up for lack of facilities it has two interesting neighbours on one side a sex shop on the other a torture museum so caused much amusement ",8.8
1699,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Very nice, clean and quiet and with great personnel. I loved staying there and am looking forward to return ",,9
2553,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"The location is fantastic - absolutely could not be better in Bruges!  Our room had windows on the canal - which would be even more appealing in warm weather, in December we still sat in them frequently and opened them a few times.  The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was filling and convenient and served in a room with another spectacular view over the canal.","Compared to the general good quality of the key comfort elements of a hotel room (bed, sheets, shower, towels) the towels were subpar.  They were worn out - overwashed, stiff and not very absorbent.  The other odd thing is that the door to the bathroom (toilet included) in our room was translucent glass - could have done without that.",8.8

The owner send an email after 2 days saying he will charge for broken lamp which is impossible that I broke it and it was next to the window which no one will use.  Please do not pay by CARD the owner will charge the money he wants without any authority.  IT IS LIKE HOSTEL.",4.2

18914,Hotel Koffieboontje,Very close to Markt Square and easy to access touristic locations,"The room was on the ground floor, it is dark inside and also cold since the room does not get any sunshine inside at all. It is also very small room, could hardly fit inside with 2 luggages. We spent one night so did not make it problem but if you plan to stay a couple of days in Brugge I would definetly not  recommend this hotel. ",5.8

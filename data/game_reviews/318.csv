531,Central Bruges B&B,"Excellent room, with a great bed, nice chairs, a lovely desk at a window, comfy carpeting, a great bathroom. Everything extremely clean and well kept. Common living-room extra cozy. Great hosts altogether.","The bathroom in our room had a curtain instead of a door. Not a big problem, given the size of the bathroom and room, but a door would be a bit better.",10

643,Central Bruges B&B,"This is probably the nicest B&B we've stayed in.  Katrien was a phenomenal host, going way out of her way to make sure our stay was truly memorable.  The room was very well appointed, very comfortable and everything seemed like it was just built yesterday.  Breakfast was fantastic, with a different assortment all three mornings we were there.  The B&B is located about 1 minute from the inbound bus stop and less than 5 min from the outbound bus stop, making getting back and forth to the train station simple.",Absolutely nothing,10

491,Central Bruges B&B,"Experience totally in line with the attractive description ! Stayed for 2 nights with my spouse. We will gladly repeat. Large room, huge bathroom & shower. Very quiet neighbourhood, abundant street-parking available in front of the door to get the luggage in/out (although expensive to stay parked there - as in all of the inner city - parking on the belt is free and 5-10 min walk) Close enough to historical city-center to walk - far enough to use different ways, and to find non-tourist bars and restaurants in the area. Very warm welcome and great breakfast, daily prepared & warm buns/croissants. Fresh water/coffe/thee available, and trusting (affordable) self-service bar at disposal all day/night.",,9
568,Central Bruges B&B,"Beautiful house finished to a high standard and fresh, local produce served for breakfast. Katrien is very warm and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Fantastic location on the edge of the centre with a lovely 10 minute walk to the main square.",,10

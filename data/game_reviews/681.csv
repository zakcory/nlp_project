The location, the beautiful renovations they have done, the incredibly friendly and welcoming staff, and did I mention the location???","The air con in the room wasnt great. Needed the windows open all day and night, but that's pretty normal for anywhere in Europe really. It wasn't a big issue at all.",10
2950,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Great location,  looks  good from outside. Reception area very modern, rooms no character,  cheap pine staircase, tatty lift and the corridors to the rooms dreadful.

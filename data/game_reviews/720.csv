5183,Hotel Du Parlement,Nothing special.,"Small rooms, small bathroom with hardly place to stand near the sink. Shower curtain kept falling down. It was a shabby impression. To expensive for the quality delivered.",3.3
4972,Hotel Du Parlement,The location is fine. Our plane was delayed for more than two hours so we came after 1 am and the receptionist patiently waited for us. Merci beaucoup,"Bathroom was rather small and narrow. There was an imitation of door, but not the real door.",7.1

5471,Hotel Du Parlement,Location is good.,"The room looked clean at first (I checked in at night and the lights in the room were quite soft), but in the morning the lack of attention to detail became evident. In my specific case there were human hair attached to the walls of the bathroom, and pencil drawings on the walls. I don't much care for the container-type bathroom, which worked well in itself, despite clear signs of wear and tear.",4.6

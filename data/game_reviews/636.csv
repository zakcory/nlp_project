6035,Hotel Belfleur,Great modern room decor and easy to find location. Dinner and breakfast were superb and the staff were very friendly.,The bed was very soft and it would be nice if they had family rooms with beds for children instead of a sofa bed.,9.6
6005,Hotel Belfleur,"The hotel is clean and comfortable, with a very good, lively, bar and restaurant, which seems to be open from breakfast through to chucking out time. Parking is plentiful and convenient. Staff are friendly and professional. The restaurant food and service are typically Belgian - i.e. very good. Breakfast is great, and the lady serving it very cheerful, so you get a nice start to the day.","A lot of rooms face out onto a fairly busy main road, so if you have an issue with noise (like I do), you're going to have difficulty getting a room to suit you.  The car park is big and convenient, but has a gravel surface. Not brilliant for heavily laden hotel guests with roller-fitted suitcases. The might want to consider tarmacking it.",8

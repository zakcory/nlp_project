On same note, it would be nice to have a safety chain/latch on the door to have it surely locked when in room.",10

The location was exceptional, in a local part of town that is close to bars and walkable to many of Brussels's good restaurants. The hosts were friendly and personable. The breakfast items were always available for snacks and the tea selections were amazing. I actually went and bought the exact same two tea blends because I loved them so much!

23633,B&B Faja lobi,"Quirky, old world style room with period furnishings. Very comfy bed.
Tea making facilities in the room and an honesty bar downstairs in the kitchen.
Breakfast was great with a bacon and eggs option cooked to order. Plenty of croissants, bread, cheese and meats. Coffee was excellent. 
Staff were friendly and welcoming. 
Easy walking distance into Ghent.
I would definitely stay again.","Bathroom toilet had a dodgy flush button and ran constantly. As I had a separate bathroom, this wasn't a big problem though.
A reminder it was a cash only payment when booking in would have been appreciated, I had to pop into town to a cash point, luckily i had left plenty of time to get to my ferry crossing!",9.6
23584,B&B Faja lobi,Maya is a very welcoming hostess and provided a great deal of local information which to make our stay more interesting than it would have been otherwise. Very good breakfast - the best on our trip to Belgium.,"A lot of mosquitoes in the bedroom. We had a top room which was good in terms of quietness and was spacious however with the need to have the windows open near to the tree foliage, mosquitoes come in. Internet is not good. We needed to have the room door open to get any signal and this was variable probably due to the number of other guests using it at the same time.",7.9

23548,B&B Faja lobi,We really liked the accomodiation. The breakfeast was good and the service too.,"We thought that in the summer it would be a little bit annoying and warm in the room because it is not possible to open the window because of the bees in the garden. It is also a little bit noisy in the houese, since the door of the entrance of the house is stucking and we woke up because our room was in the first floor towards the entrance.",9.6

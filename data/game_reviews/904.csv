646,Marivaux Hotel,"Arriving at this hotel via public transport was very easy.  The hotel is easy to find and during check-in, we thought the front desk was great.  The elevator system is a bit wonky but the room was large, quiet and comfortable.  We only had 1 night stay.  We did have breakfast and found it to have a lot of choices.  It was very international, as one would expect in Brussels.  Getting to the center of the city - Grand Place was a breeze.  It was less than 10 min walk, if I remember correct.  I would recommend this hotel easily.",,9

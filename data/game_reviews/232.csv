20123,B&B La Porte Cochere,Extremely friendly & interesting hosts that made us feel really most welcome. Very comfortable and spacious accommodation in a convenient but quiet spot in the town. We were traveling home from further afield and decided to break the journey in Ypres so only stayed one night. Could not recommend enough and will return for a longer stay next time.. Thank you!,,10

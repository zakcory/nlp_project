9344,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"Good choice, they even had juices and sufficient choice of meals. My room was plenty spacious and even had its own wash sink with large mirror.",I would prefer if shower room could be locked. Locker size in rooms is too small. The night reception is little unintuitively disguised as a bar.,6

8347,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"They have soymilk and vegan options(margarine, marmalade, fruits) for breakfast. Breakfast is included and pretty okay for a hostel 
Check out is easy 
"," It wasn't clean. The trashbin in our room wasn't even empty
Check in was not really flexible. We waited almost an hour. And then there was a queue

Ouh and the beds aren't comfortable and there is no elevator but how I already said for the price it's okay ",7.1

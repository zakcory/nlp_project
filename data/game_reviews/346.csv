5652,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,Beds were comfy and the showers were clean. Location was excellent and easy to get to on foot from the station. The 24x7 reception helped because I did not have to worry about delays on my way to Bruges.,No handwash was provided in the toilets.  The bar was open till 4am and the noise carried to the rooms somewhat.  But I wasn't too fussed about it as I still got some decent sleep. The staff could have been friendlier.,8.8

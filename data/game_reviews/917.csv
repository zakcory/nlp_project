8977,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,Being just a 5 minute walk from Eurostar and a 15 minute walk from the Grand Place was just fantastic. The room was spacious and clean and the staff were very kind and accommodating. Even though the hotel is situated on a busy road the rooms were very quiet due to great sound proofing. During the night there was a very disruptive guest in another room but within 5 minutes of ringing reception silence returned to the hotel. Leaving our cases at reception on our last day while we continued to visit the Christmas markets to pick them up before catching our train just helped for a stress free weekend. Great customer service!,,7.9
9329,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,"Check in was easy and because it was 37 degrees they gave us extra cold water. Room was lovely and spacious, very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful.",The hotel was situated near the station but the area was very run down. I went with my daughter and as we walked around we felt vulnerable and at times unsafe. Just a few doors from the hotel is a sex shop and a sex show club.,8.8

9257,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,"Room and bathroom were huge, the extra large bed was amazing, the staff were all lovely, really large selection of food at the buffet breakfast, hotel so close to the Eurostar station. Even though our room was at the front of the hotel and by a very busy road the soundproofing was brilliant, slept really well the whole of our stay","The road Hotel Mercury is on always seemed to have men hanging around it in groups in the evening, it definitely made my husband and myself feel uneasy when walking past them to get into the city or to the lovely restaurants by the station. ",8.3
9382,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,Room was clean,"Made 2 complaints about noise from a neighbouring room. Hotel staff did nothing about this, noise continued. Had a terrible nights sleep. Spoke to reception staff about this when checking out, they were completely disinterested with our comments and reluctantly gave an apology. Manager was ""not around"" to speak to. No compensation was offered. Awful stay.",3
9632,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,Close to Eurostar.  Good breakfast and shower.,"Awful service, did not feel safe in this location.",5.4
8940,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,"The hotel itself was lovely, clean and modern. The room was very spacious and had everything we needed. It was roughly a 5 minute walk from the train station so was very handy as we had lots of bags to carry!","The atmosphere around the hotel made us feel quite unsafe, the area was dirty and run down. However, when the road works along the road of the hotel are complete this may improve. We walked into the centre on the first day but the people nearby made us feel uneasy so we got ubers for the rest of our trip.",8

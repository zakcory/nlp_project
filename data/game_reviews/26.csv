11866,Alliance Hotel Ieper Centrum,Comfortable rooms and very clean,Narrow staircase,7.9
11708,Alliance Hotel Ieper Centrum,Location spot on,Parking a bit iffy but expected for the location,9.2
11279,Alliance Hotel Ieper Centrum,"The breakfast was excellent and good value for money.  The breakfast table was topped up regularly and everything was fresh. There was plenty of choice and the it was served in a lovely dining room, it was like being in alarge house rather than a hotel.","Nothing, everything was perfect and far surpassed my expectations. I would certainly recommend it to friends and I would stay there again if visiting Ypres. It was ideally located and within easy reach of all the main attraction.",9
11747,Alliance Hotel Ieper Centrum,Visited previously and like the hotel would stay there again,,9.6
11889,Alliance Hotel Ieper Centrum,,Parking not directly at hotel because of street building works - also made hotel a bit hard to find - presumably only a temporary problem,8.8
11760,Alliance Hotel Ieper Centrum,"The location cannot be faulted, a few paces away from the main square. Free parking available about 10 minutes from the hotel on the road after Menin Gate which is called Leopold III Lan. Breakfast was OK. As I think others have stated it's a bit more like a B & B than a hotel. Door is locked by 10.00, and once much earlier, so you have to access with a code, which is not a problem. Ypres has very good restaurants and bars and the In Flanders Fields museum is excellent.",There are about 6 chalet style rooms to the rear of the hotel and we had one of those. Decor and facilities I would best describe as basic. Towels extremely thin. Rooms may be better in the main hotel.,5
11174,Alliance Hotel Ieper Centrum,It was okay but I was a bit lonley as I was the only one staying at the hotel,There was no  coffee and tea in the room,8

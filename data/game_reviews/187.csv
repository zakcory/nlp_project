14253,B&B Chester,"Everything about this place was beyond anything I've expected - couldn't be located more centrally and yet in a quiet square so you don't get any main street noise; the amenities and the room itself were incredibly high standard, clean and well thought through. And the breakfast.. I have no words, we were in heaven!! Overall, I will never look at any other place to stay when in Bruges.",Nothing to say here,10

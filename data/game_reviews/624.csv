460,Hotel Astoria Gent,"Relaxed, private vibe, spacious, quiet  room with a garden view, surprise bath with jacuzzi for no extra costs, slightly (5 min) further than other hotels but much better quality. I really enjoyed my stay.",,8.3
110,Hotel Astoria Gent,"Very easy check-in (nobody at reception, but instructions were given via email and were very clear). The room was very clean, beautiful bathroom with rituals soap. The new windows blocked out the noise of  the trains. 
Thanks to the foodcorner we had a very nice dinner (Lasagna and ice cream), and breakfast in the room was also very good (large choice available).
Would love to go again :)",Nothing,9

450,Hotel Astoria Gent,"We got a bigger room than we had expected. Everything was really fine, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. They even let us leave our luggage in the reception after check-out. Everybody was very friendly.","Considering the fact that we came to Gent in February, the prices could have been a little lower. But in the end, it was worth it, Belgium is a very beautiful country (especially Gent and Bruges).  We would have appreciated an earlier check-in, but it was not possible.",9.6
345,Hotel Astoria Gent,"Rooms were clean and a good standard- particularly the bathroom, which looked recently renovated. Breakfast was fantastic and very good value for money.",The only downside to my stay was the lack of sound insulation from TV noise coming from adjacent rooms. I could almost hear the words spoken on whatever programme was on.,9.2

705,Novotel Gent Centrum,The location,"Requested an upgrade because superior room w sofabed was so cramped and dark. Girl at reception accomodated friendly. But hygiene in the ecexutive room was repulsive, dog hairs on the carpet, even after mentioning to staff, when we went out for dinner and came back, were still there. Bedsheets with stains and 3 out of 4 (all of the kids on sofabed) were ripped. Decor damaged, dusty and outdated. Told kids not to touch anything. One of worst hotel stays ever. In the end managed not to pay for upgrade, but gentleman who checked us out should not have let us pay at all!",3.8

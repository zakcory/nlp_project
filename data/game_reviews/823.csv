19549,Hotel Old Tom,Very little!,"Decorating appalling, carpets filthy, stair banister broken (dangerous), bed should be in a skip. Price much too high for this poor quality of hotel - presumably boosted by the location.",5
19767,Hotel Old Tom,Room was good comfortable bed view out of the window over the square was nice although fair on therefore noisy especially the hooter to stop/start the bumper cars but not hotels fault. Food was excellent staff great apart from the above all good.,Breakfast too expensive and unable to accommodate our gluten intolerant also no facility for tea coffee in the room but that seems to be a continental thing as Amsterdam was the same.,8.8
19117,Hotel Old Tom,The food was excellent and staff very friendly and welcoming,The rooms we stayed in need major overhaul beds uncomfortable sheets ripped tho looks like work in progress as down stays clean and done up,6.3
19313,Hotel Old Tom,"Great location, coffee, staff were so helpful Sergio especially, great food particuy the mussels !",The restaurant and bar areas beautiful however the hotel rooms need re-decoration.,8.8
19231,Hotel Old Tom,"Hotel is located in the town square, a very short walk to the Menin Gate. Shops and restaurants and tour providers also very close. Ypres train station is only a few minutes by car, or about 15 minutes walk, from Old Tom. Good breakfast. Helpful friendly staff. It is a very old building, and the facilities reflect this. But everything works, it's clean and very reasonably priced.",,8.8
19171,Hotel Old Tom,The location and the view. Staff helpful with luggage.,"We weren't told that the hotel is unattended, closed on Wednesday which meant we had no breakfast which was included in the tariff. We were compensated 10 euros. Should have been 20, the price of two breakfasts.",7.5
19149,Hotel Old Tom,"I booked The Old Tom as I had stayed there about 20 years ago and it is perfectly placed in the main square in Ypres with excellent access to local facilities as well as the Menin Gate, the Cloth Hall Museum and many other locations of interest. The staff were very helpful in an understated way and the breakfast was fine. The rooms were clean with good views over the square  All in all, we really enjoyed our stay.",The steps to the rooms on the third floor were steep and would be problematic for people with infirmities. It would have been good to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room and we did have trouble in finding the pre-booked garage. A small printed road plan with clear directions would help.,8.8

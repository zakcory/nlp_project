1926,Art de Sejour - B&B,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights. We liked everything about this property. The first thing that catches you is the clean smell as you walk in the room. The architecture of the rooms are well thought out with tall ceilings and clean artistic designs. The towels smelled delicious. The second thing was the breakfast. The vitamin shots every morning did the trick. Finally, the host, Mario was the best. He guided us about everything. Where to walk, what to see, where to get the best beers and the best food. Our stay was everything we were looking for. Very relaxing. We will surely visit again. ",,10

2642,Art de Sejour - B&B,"Large, beautiful room. The photos did not do this place justice. We were blown away by how big the room was coming from a hotel in Paris lol such a great price/value. Mario was a lovely host as well! We would stay here again in a heart beat.",Nothing at all!,10
1855,Art de Sejour - B&B,Mario has renovated this property brilliantly. He is an unbelievable host who is caring and efficient at the same time. Our room had a very interesting bathtub which fills from the bottom rather than the conventional tap. The room was beautifully appointed and the back window looked into a garden where fairy lights lit up at night. The breakfast was individually prepared to each person's wishes and was plentiful and fresh. We would definitely recommend Art de Sejour to anyone who wants a five star experience in Brussels,Nothing,9.6

1796,Thon Residence Florence Aparthotel,"Perfect accommodation in the city center. Spacious and very well equipped apartment with balcony. You feel like at home, but in Busel. The reception is at a nearby hotel where you will be asked to pay a $ 100 Euro deposit during check-in, which was returned after check-out. Everything works very well and reliably. I warmly recommend.",,10
1770,Thon Residence Florence Aparthotel,"Very nicely furnished living room with a bedroom. Modern kitchen, with all the necessary amenities. Very friendly and helpful hotel staff.  The hotel where keys are picked up has a 24-hour reception and is very close to apartment. Pleasant surroundings (close to shops, restaurants).","Old bathroom and toilet, pretty ruined and not very clean. I was wondering when the hair dryer would break down because it was quite old and damaged.  The smell in the toilet was terrible, they could invest in some cleaning products. The surprise was also a deposit of 100 Euros, I had not found this information before on the website, but there was no problem with returning the money at check-out.",8.3
1758,Thon Residence Florence Aparthotel,Very nice and convenient appartment,I think the price could be a bit lower having in mind it does not include breakfast,7.1

1836,Thon Residence Florence Aparthotel,It was very clean and modern and everything I needed was there,"1. The address was given as 91-93 Avenue Louise. You check in there but the apartment is several hundred metres away at 9 Rue Florence. Not helpful with a suitcase, rain etc especially if your taxi has left!
2. The mezzanine arrangement is a horror - suitcase up those hazardous tiny stairs! 
3. Far too expensive at $200 a night",5.5
1810,Thon Residence Florence Aparthotel,The location is perfect.,"The bathroom is old and shabby. The apartment has no soul, the decoration is poor. I didn't like staying there, luckily they gave me a room in the hotel. The staff was helpful and friendly to handle the case.",5.4

Breakfast: excellent, good variety of products and excellent and friendly service. Location: cannot be better, and even parking turned out to be not a problem (maybe we were lucky..) Very spacious room and all amenities present.","Shower is a bit small, and it would be convenient to have something to place the shampoo and shower gel on. Hose of hand shower needs replacing. Other than this everything was fine.",9.2

22481,B&B De Bornedrager,"B&B Bornedrager is a gem! Low-key sophistication greets you upon entry. The restoration of the townhouse & the refined decor is lovely. The hostess, Kathleen, wants to make sure that you have a wonderful stay, not only in the B&B, but also in Bruges. She is very helpful regarding sites & Tours. Breakfast is wonderful: eggs cooked to order, cereals, juices, fresh yogurt, fresh fruit cup, sparkling wine, if you would like it. Cheeses, meats, a variety of breakfast breads Etc. Our room was large & lovely with tea/coffee maker, fridge, safe. Comfy bed & upholstered chairs for reading. Bathroom is large and has modern furnishings. The location is terrific: you can walk everywhere. This B&B is a gem! We stayed for four days and loved every moment. Thank you, Kathleen",Nothing!,10

15499,D.Cristina Guest House,Good wifi. Communal kitchen OK.,Horrible location. Hard to get to and very hard to find. No name on building. Only a number. Tram stop was about a 15-20 minute walk. I only saw the owner on the day I arrived. Very limited English. +No lift. Steep stairs to get to my room.,4.6
15216,D.Cristina Guest House,"Newly renovated, clean place, right next to a new park and in walking distance to the city center (about 20+ min.). Free coffee and tea.","The staff who registered me only spoke Portugese, no English. At first, I had a room without a window, which was totally unexpected and hard to deal with. Fortunately, I was able to move to a different room for my second night. The neighborhood seems to be up and coming, but still a little rough around the edges.",7.5
15318,D.Cristina Guest House,The location is great despite looking at the map it might look like a little out. All is really good there and it is very easy to find. That is not always true in some places.,"Well, the floors are creaking and it is true that the house is not very sound-proof. That didn't bother me apart from the fact that I didn't bring my headphones and had to listen to music as low as humanly possible.",9.2
15178,D.Cristina Guest House,"It was very cozy, beautiful and perfect for what I needed. ","The walls are very thin. You can hear everyone talking, even moving through the walls.",9
15194,D.Cristina Guest House,"free coffee, good average between price and ""what you've got"",  I made a check-in earlier than  they normally do and it wasn't a problem, clean, wifi worked","nothing to really cook;  there are a microwave, a fridge and something to boil water but that s all if you have a room near the street, could be a bit noisy the evening",9.2
15436,D.Cristina Guest House,"Good clean accomodation with a nice kitchen. About 12 minutes on foot to the railway station, close to the port.","Toilet seat was a bit broken, other than that - no complaints.",10
15229,D.Cristina Guest House,"Very clean, neat and comfortable",A little far from the center for walking,9.2

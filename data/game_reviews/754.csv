18265,Hotel Koffieboontje,"The cleaning was ok, the hotel is cheap and you are in the inner city. The breakfast is nice.","The bell tower is directly beside the hotel so there is never silence. Furthermore the walls are so thin that even without the bells there's never silence. You can here everything you neighbor does. The cleaning hours are really weird, between 15-16 o'clock. That's when I normally want to do little break at the hotel, why do they not clean in the morning? The bed is very uncomfortable because it's too soft. The restaurant is very expensive but very bad. The doors were really weird I was never sure if they were locked.",5.8

5984,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,"This is a hostel so expect to share if you book late but they do have some double and twin rooms available no ensuite but all is kept nice and clean can be a bit noisy at times but again dont complain if you book into a place with an all night bar,lively spot with great staff awesome pizzas and a party vibe ",Very steep narrow stairways may be a problem if you have issues with stuff like that and not ideal if your carrying loads of luggage but again remember it is a hostel and not a hotel i have given the high marks for a hostel so dont expect 5 star luxury,10
5616,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,"The location is perfect, in the city center, everything are few minutes walking distance. The stle of bar really good. The room was clean and comfortable, bed also comfortable. Breakfast for extra 4 Euro was good (bread, butter, jam, nutella, egg, tea and coffee) but some meet and cheese missed.","In the room was no cabinet or some place to keep our bags, clothes, just on the floor or in the bed. For 6 person just 3 electrical plug in and 2 chairs. In the shower no shelf for shower gel and water temperatur not possible to change. In the toilette no soap and some paper.",7.5

5761,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,Good price and value + amazing location close to the center. Also very nice atmosphere by the bar downstairs. Checkin was very easy and flexible at the bar.,"The only thing that bothered me was that there could have been a small table in the room and the info sheet on the window was a bit dirty. I think we saw in the description also that there is one bed for 2 people, but in fact there were 2 beds (just a small detail, we then put the beds together).",8.3

24004,B&B Domein Rodin,"An excellent place to stay if you are looking for a peaceful rest in the country side. Property is done with taste, well maintained, impeccably clean and hosts are incredibly kind and forthcoming. Our stay with a little baby was made very comfortable with a cot and high chair for the little one. We had a triple room with amazing bath and sauna. Breakfast is home made and fresh with wide variety of pastries, meat, cheese and much more for every taste. We will definitely come back when the open-air swimming pool is open in summer. Well done!",Everything was perfect!,10

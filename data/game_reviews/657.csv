4116,Hotel Boterhuis,"Lovely breakfast
Happy staff. Very attentive. I had an operation so i asked for extra pillows and the receptionist bought me one straight away.  Receptionist sho2ed me nice places to eat on a map and reccomended things to do. Minutes a way from the centre by foot. ",The hotel was brilliant. Nice and chic. Would have loved a bath tub but not too fussed. Also cheaper if you book there instead of booking.com. Also the aircondition didn't have a warm setting. I was sort of cold at one point.,10

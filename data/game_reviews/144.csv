934,Avenue Beach Hotel,"In mid-season the price is very nice. The sealine is in 3-4 minutes walk. Some shops and local restaurants are nearby where you can see a lot of locals, not just tourists like in city centre. The reception is very friendly, the check-in and check-out were fast and without problems.","No ventilation in the room and very bad ventilation in the bathroom, that is why it was quite wet and too hot. The spare balconies do not give a lot of comfort. The beds are too soft, and you hear all the noise in the corridor.",7.1

15876,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,Lovely place to stay with lots of charm. Great balance of activities. Staff very kind and competent.,The family lodging was like a dormitory without any charm in contrast to the rest of the place. Just 4 beds little furniture and the ceiling beams at 1.65 m high were like obstacles. So quality for price no what we expected.,8

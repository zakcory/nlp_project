3200,Hotel Montana,,"NIGHTMARE. We went with a friend who had a single room. Unfortunately when he went to bed some itching started. He looked closer and found many small insects on the sheet in the bed. No one at the reception at 23h. Our friend couldn't sleep the whole night. When we complained the next day, the owner was extremly nasty, unfriendly and he ignored fully what had happened..",2
3011,Hotel Montana,We had a family room with two extra beds so there was enough space. The hotel is a bit old and the design is old fashioned but it good enough for at least one night. The bathroom was quite small but the shower was good. No real extra's in the room but that was expected. Breakfast and location are good.,A little redesigning and this could be a nice old-fashioned styled hotel and they could even ask a bit more money for the rooms :-),7

6396,Hostel Bruegel,"Location is great! A lot of nice places nearby just walking. The whole place is very clean and tidy. The common areas are confortable. You can leave your belongs there even after the check-out. Plus: the church in front is lovely, totally worth it to visit",,8.8
6987,Hostel Bruegel,Staff were very friendly and the location is superb,"The shower didn't have pressure, the beds were  extremely uncomfortable and at night it was very cold. ",6.3
5683,Hostel Bruegel,"Location, people, nice breakfast, amazing staff.",Annoying light in bathroom that turns off every 5 seconds.,9.6
6799,Hostel Bruegel,"The location was very good for the value. It is close to all main sights, so you do not need to use any kind of transport. The breakfast was very basic but alright: toasts, eggs, nutella, jams, etc. The twin room was clean and good size.","We asked for the double room, but still two twin beds were given. The beds were quite uncomfortable and also the triangle roof is very close to your head, so be careful while getting up from the bed. Regarding the shower, you need to push the button every 7-10 seconds for the constant water flow.",7.9

5824,Hostel Bruegel,"Hostel was clean. I stayed in a 4-bed room and there was a small shower in the room (the door has a gap so it's not really private, however it's only a shower) which I personally don't like much as it only creates more noises if someone showers early/ late. But that's my personal opinion. .. They have a nice garden area and it's close to the city centre.
The breakfast is great. I expected toast and butter, but they also have some fruits, cereals, eggs coffee (specialists) and tea. ","as above shower in the room.
The mattresses have a kind of plastic protection I guess to make it more hygienic/ easier to clean. It wasn't for as I didn't sleep very well on those and it's also noisy when moving around.",7.5
5632,Hostel Bruegel,Very clean. Nice helpful staff.,The beds were not very comfortable and taking a shower while keeping the bathroom light on required speed and dexterity.,7.5

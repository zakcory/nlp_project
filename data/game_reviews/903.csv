2733,Marivaux Hotel,Great location.  Staff very nice & helpful.  Only stayed one night but was pleasant.,Toilet had no sink..  There was a separate bathroom though with a sink & shower. You had to leave the toilet in the hall area to go back through the room & into the bathroom to wash your hands. Just found that strange.  See the point to have separate toilet but put a sink in there while you are at it..,6.7

2478,Marivaux Hotel,,"Bed bugs were found in the room (live ones). The staff took time to admit that the hotel had been treated weeks before, despite the strong smell of chemical products.
3 months after, I am still waiting for the reimbursement of the dry cleaning of my clothes despite that I paid the hotel bill.",2
2850,Marivaux Hotel,Nice location very close to the cozy small shopping streets of old town. Super fast wifi. Check out service was great. The room was quite big.,The covers and pillows were not great. The cover very stiff. The bathroom sink area seemed quite disgusting due to tear and wear on the marble. Looked incredibly dirty. Room was somewhat basic while trying to give the appearance of quality.,6.3

Seemed to be a drainage issue.",7.5

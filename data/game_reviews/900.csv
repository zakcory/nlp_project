512,Marivaux Hotel,"We love this hotel. We have stayed here twice now and it has been one of the best hotels we have stayed in. The staff are great and very helpful on arrival. The room was ready for us at 11am instead of 3pm which was very convenient. The room was great with high ceilings making the area feel a lot larger which was nice. The room has all the features you could ask for; two TV's, a shower/bath, free grooming set etc. Loved this hotel.",,10

2755,Marivaux Hotel,,"I have never experienced paying deposit in any hotel. They asked to guaratuee with 20euros beyond you pay the whole amount right after arrival. For not so cheap hotel in the centre it is guite embarrasing. Room is big but with old wooden furniture. Bathroom is fine but average, not so clean.",5.8

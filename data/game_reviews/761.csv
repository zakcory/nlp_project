17118,Hotel Koffieboontje,location,Would never recommend this place. Dull and scruffy. Shower curtain too long in tray but too narrow to reach walls. Hence bathroom floor floods. You would not want to walk in bedroom with bare feet. The whole place is depressing and will spoil your visit to a lovely city.,6.9

15186,D.Cristina Guest House,"The property is a large, clean modern townhouse with good amenities and within walking distance of the train station and the zoo.  After my first night (of the 2) I was moved to a lighter upstairs room with a window.  Great value for money with free coffee and wi-fi. On an additional note the owner's are absolutely amazing, a friend sent me mail which arrived after I had checked out of D.Cristina.  The owner's very kindly took the mail to the post office and arranged for it to be sent onto me in England (lifesavers).

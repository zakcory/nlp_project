4353,Hotel Lido,"The staff was very friendly, despite the restrictions related to COVID 19. The rooms met our expectations: they were spacious and very clean. The breakfast was tasty and it was nice to be able to take a breakfast outside in the sun.",I needed one single paper copied and scanned and it was too bad that the staff did not aloud me to do so. I understand that the hotel is no copy center but it was just a very small request to avoid me the extra hassle of having to drive to a distant copy shop.,8

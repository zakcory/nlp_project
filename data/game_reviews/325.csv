26123,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"Great location, but over experience is poor. The furniture was old. There were unscrewed bolts showing from one of the the beds. The bathroom in general was clean, except the bathtub, which was  unusable. Most surfaces were dusty. A lot of dust in the room in general. The carpet had stains. In a room with 4 beds there were only 2 electric outputs - one of them next to the door. Only one of the four people at the reception actually was helpful. Cleaning lady did not come to clean the room when we put the sign, but everyday at about 4pm, while our baby was sleeping - so no one cleaned the room for four days, though she offered change of towels every time.",,2
25235,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"The hotel was just across the train station and round the corner from pubs, restaurants and shops.  The receptionists were always very helpful with providing information we required to get around Antwerp. The room was warm and the heated bathroom flooring was awesome :) Very clean rooms!","We left our luggage in the luggage room until it was time to check in, no tags, no checking who took what and which.  Not secure at all..",8.3
24934,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"Amazingly, for its tiny size, the room had all the essentials (except for a fridge), even a table with 2 chairs. Location is perfect for me - literally right across the central train station. It's a bit noisy with windows open but I am not bothered by that",Wifi didn't work at all. I stayed only one night so didn't bother trying to talk with the staff about it. Signal was good but there was no internet - its possible that it could have been fixed by the staff. The room was tiny and there was no fridge. Windows can't be fully opened - only tilted,7.1
25978,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"Ideal location next to Antwerp Central Station, Common areas could do with a lick of paint, but my room & shower facilities etc were clean and the bed was comfortable. The shower worked well.  There was a good selection of items included in the buffet breakfast.  The staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful",As ever on the continent there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room,9.6

","The lights in the room and in the toilette did not work, since it was a Saturday nobody came to fix it, just the receptionist came to take a look, but of course he is not an electrician so he wasn't of much help. No room change was offered since they were full. One of the towels had a hole in it. ",6

12300,Grand Hotel de Flandre,"Clean room,  clean & spacious bathroom",Location and entrance Parking was initially not really clear due to road works in town and not recognizable by GPS.  Strange and marginal people hanging around in the vicinity of the hotel which is located across the train station which may give you an unpleasant feeling of being not safe. Although there's a facility in providing a protective glass door which prevents splashing water while taking a shower standing upward in the bath : one ends up in a swimming pool when stepping out of the bath after being showered ( wet floor ) as water flows in between the glass door and the bath  => tried preventing this the next time by putting a towel in between that gap ..  but unfortunately in vain :(,6

24135,Hygge Hotel,It's a new hotel with limited facilities.,"It's a badly designed hotel. Rooms are too small for a 3 star property. The family room we booked was on 5th floor but the elevator was up to 4th floor only. The room was so hot and there was no A/c. It was impossible to carry all our luggage to the top. When asked, the hotel staff gave us a double room on 1st floor which was very small and there was no window for the room. The receptionist was kind enough to give us a fan which as per him 'is the best fan in Brussels'. It made a motor running sound but there was no use of it. ",5.4
22441,Hygge Hotel,"Great value and great location, situated outside the city but walking distance (1 min ) to Louisa Avenue, a famous shopping district. but it will take you 20 mins to walk to Grand Place. the bedroom is nice and the bed is comfy !","the shower over the bath, when u hang the shower head, water squirts everywhere, literally i had to use 2 towels to wipe the water all over the bathroom floors, later on i had to sit on the edge of the bath and slowly shower, floors still wet but not as bad as when u hang it up . the bath glass door needs to widen to prevent water coming out",9.2
24184,Hygge Hotel,,"The room doesnt clean yet, till 5 'clock, staff didnt help us to do something better and we have to leave my baggers inside the room while housekeeping clear the room. And when come back we find out The room was no air con so hot, we have to change the room at midnight. The Manager so bad doesnt help anything, never contact us to do something better.",2.9

23133,Hygge Hotel,"Very clean, nice bathroom, delicious breakfast and great location (close to the European Parliament etc). The staff is very friendly.","The room is very tiny, and almost has no window. Feels a bit cramped.",8.3
24168,Hygge Hotel,Breakfast is correct but not exceptional.  The personal is friendly and polite The design is modern and nice,"There is no air conditioned. For a 3 stars hotel which charges you 170 Euros/night, it is totally unacceptable. In summer (my stay was in June)  you have to sleep with the windows opened and there is some noise in the streets.  I was also disappointed when I arrived, there was only one person at the reception who does everything (bar tender, answers to the phone, receptionist). I had to wait about 10 minutes to get my room key... Here again, for that category of hotel and associated price, you expect a better service for your money.",4.2
24099,Hygge Hotel,"Good location just 20 minutes walk to all major landmarks. Good array of shops near the hotel. Clean room, they changed the towels on a daily basis. Good breakfast although they tend to close it at 10 sharp.","There is a big problem, because the hotel does not have air conditioning and if you are going in summer, end of June and beginning of July, you will receive only a portable fan which is insufficient. So for this price and a little extra pay I could have stayed in a 4 star hotel with AC. It is sad because the hotel was recently renovated and they should have taken this aspect into account.",7.1

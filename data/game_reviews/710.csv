25105,Hotel Du Congres,The room I had was cozy and just right for me. It's simple and clean.,It was a walk from and to the central train station. It may take some people 15 minutes but someone who never been there it's more then 15 min. It's also quite a bit of a walk to the central plaza. Dragging my luggage on the cobble stone sidewalk was not easy.,8.3
25765,Hotel Du Congres,"The bathroom was all renovated and very clean, although really small.
Friendly staff and good breakfast for a fair price.",The double room I booked was a bit disappointing because the queen bed (only one) was so small..,7.1
25884,Hotel Du Congres,Great comfortable bed and room with balcony was exceptional!,Was great overall but there was a smell of cigar when entering the room!,7.9
25819,Hotel Du Congres,"Just a minute away from many various restaurants, a subway station and a tram stop. The room was pretty silent, everything worked. Nice selection of bread and grains at breakfast.","The single room was pretty basic: no kettle, no fridge, no storage box. Only two power sockets: you'll need to choose between charging your laptop or turning a desk lamp on. It's a bit cold in winter, but quite a right amount for me.",8.3
25506,Hotel Du Congres,Was really comfy room.,"They should put air condition for summer and 1 mirrow on the room, just one in the toilet",7.9
25719,Hotel Du Congres,"The hotel was in a perfect position for the purpose I had in Brussels, easy to access. The breakfast war just fine. I had troubles with self cooked egs, but the rest was just ok.","Even though I expected no luxtury, the room I stayed in had such a heavy smell that it was difficult to relax.",7.1
26001,Hotel Du Congres,Ground floor reception was all veryy satisfactory and a good standard of breakfast,"I had a poorly presented room which was more like a hostel - over hot and no opportunity to regulate. 
No material about Brussels in the room
No water or option too make a tea",6

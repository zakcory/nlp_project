10700,Holiday Home Ipericus,Excellent Location,Only negative two flights of stairs to go to toilet.  Steep stair may be a struggle for some people not sure if these are mentioned in the advert but should be indicated as this will affect some people,7.9
10483,Holiday Home Ipericus,The location was incredible. The home was lovely. There was a thorough welcome pack with all sorts of tips and recommendations about the town. Also coupons for activities. Also the towels were big and fluffy! I also enjoyed the little enclosed courtyard. (Very tiny but nice in the summer),"The double bed was up two steep narrow flights of stairs, and the sloped ceiling prevented standing up in the room. It was impossible to get luggage all the way up there.  The single bed was actually a daybed doubling as a couch in the sitting room up one floor. You have to go through that room to get to the attic bedroom. But for the location, it is worth it.",9.2
10649,Holiday Home Ipericus,"The house is in a fantastic location within 5 minutes walk to the centre of Ypres. It has every little extra you can think of, including beer in the fridge which was so appreciated after a long drive. Everybody was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Although we loved the quirky stairs for two flights of stairs which weren't s problem for us, elderly or infirm people may struggle here. All in all, a fabulous little house and we would definitely stay here again if we visited Ypres again. Thank you Bernard and Maria.  ",,10

6878,B&B La Gotale,"The breakfast was great! Hilde made it really tasty! If there was something, you could ask her anything. The rooms and the bathroom were beautiful, even the kitchen, the living room,..a very charming house. I totally loved it! The view was great, we were lucky that it just snowed. There is also parking, nothing negative to say!  Great stay! I would recommend it to everyone :)  Groetjes Annelies & Anthony",Nothing!,10
6839,B&B La Gotale,"Very good hotel located in quiet area, perfect to rest. Breakfast was good. Kitchen where you can grab everything you need and big living room downstairs for everyone are making it feel like home. The hotel host is always friendly and ready to help with anything.",Everything was good but i think with current facilities the price for a room was a bit too high.,9.6
6813,B&B La Gotale,Hildy was an excellent host. Very friendly and did the most amazing breakfasts for us! The room was really clean and comfortable and the bathroom was large with a very good shower.,"It was quite warm when we were there so a fan in the room would have been nice and the pillows were very squishy which is not my taste (this is personal though others may prefer this), however these are minor issues and didn't detract from the fact we had a brilliant stay here.",9
6688,B&B La Gotale,It is a perfect location with a great view on the landscape.  Very good meals in the evening and excellent breakfast. The hostess is very friendly and makes time to talk with you.,wifi can be better.  But for the rest everything ok !,10
6890,B&B La Gotale,"We enjoyed the stay at La-Gotale, the pleasant hospitality of Hilda, the beautiful landscape around, the huge house which designed perfectly by Hilda (Charming and also an Architect), the tasty and colored breakfasts each morning were joyful for all of us, especially to the kids which were excited with the brown morning ;) The house itself is very comfortable, besides our room facilities, there is the big living room for all guests, with fruits, coffee and tea bar. For travelers, cycling or walking, the location is amazing, also for families but if the kids getting hungry after getting back home, take under consideration that you will need to drive about 30 minutes to find open restaurant (burgers, pizza, cafe, ice-cream. etc.).",,10
6865,B&B La Gotale,"Beautiful boutique B&B. Perfect location for a weekend of walks, good food nearby and exploring the area.
The breakfast was excellent and the surroundings beautiful. You need to stay here!",Nothing bad to say. Only thing is that we didn't have toiletries nor WiFi details in the bedroom.,10
6655,B&B La Gotale,This charming property was better than we could have imagined! Unfortunately we could only stay for one night but wish it was for longer. Thank you Hilde for a delicious breakfast & a lovely stay at your beautifully renovated property. We hope to be back someday!,,10

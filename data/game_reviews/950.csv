11545,Orbita Hotel,"I am a very frequent traveler, staying in multiple cities all over the world, but the service provided in Orbita was the best all across the locations I've been in the past. The stuff is the most kind, supportive and welcoming, I've ever experienced. The level of professionalism is exceeding all possible expectations. Starting with the support at the reception over to excellent service at cafe and restaurant, and to the cleaning service - an amazing experience, highly recommended to other travelers. The rooms are causy and well-equipped, with brand new electric supplies - boiler and heating system.",,10
11914,Orbita Hotel,This hotel is very close to metro. Also around the hotel some supermarkets and restaurants. Not in center but easy to get go everywhere.,"Hotel is too old. It's cold 3 stars hotel but it is as 1 star hotel. In entrance there is no bellboy to help your baggage. Inside of the room is too cold and too old furniture and bad. Also, when i asked some questions to reception about address registration she just told that she doesn't know it and than i asked from her to ask her manager for information and she told me that today just i work and i don't know anything about it. I do not recommend to anyone to stay there.",3

11936,Orbita Hotel,Is there anything to like here apart from a warm room.,"Very disappointed to have been disturbed by noise next door, asked to be moved to a quieter place away from a kids football team. the next night, having to wake up at 5.50am i couldn't sleep because of what sounded like a ""party"" between two men and woman going on. Decided to get up and just check out at 1am because of it. went down to reception fully dressed and ready to just leave, i was given the keys to another room in a more quiet place in the hotel.  i really was not happy about any of this, while feeling unwell from a stomach bug i'd picked up. I have stayed in this hotel many times since 2012 and something always happens there. they really need to step up their game.",1

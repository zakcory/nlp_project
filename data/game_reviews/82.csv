16089,Apartment Chez Esmara et Philippe,"Spacious for 4 people, fully equipped kitchen, ideal location in the city center where all shops, restaurants and markets are within a walking distance (no need for  a car)",Bathroom standards is unfortunately less than expected when you compare it with an almost 9 out of 10 rating: i mean here the toilet room is too tight and the toilet papers have no hanger!  The bathtub doesn't drain the water quickly in case you want to take a shower. Plus a pipe supposed to be for a washing machine is only blocked with a pack of napkins!,8.8

Good location, just next to a hypermarket and to a gas station,  that works 24/7, where you can buy tea, coffee and pastries any time. 
Good breakfasts. 
The area around the hotel is green, there is a river and lots of greenery.
In general,  I enjoyed my stay.","No teapot and fridge in the room. 
No porter service. Nobody will assist you with your luggage. Uncomfortable to carry bags through small  stairs on the way to the elevator.

3960,Novotel Brussels City Centre,Perfect location close to places of interest and restaurants.,"Not a 4 start hotel. Not as clean as pristine as expected. Will do a good value for money for 3 stars.

4080,Novotel Brussels City Centre,,"Clearly a rip-off. Rooms are small and dirty. Carpet in corridor and room is particularly filthy. My room was not cleaned properly, toilet and bathroom only marginally cleaned. We all know that chain hotels, such as Novotel, are not the most classy or stylish but that is compensated by a good price ratio (value for money) but 325 Euro for two nights for a 4 star hotel is definitely not a deal. This hotel is not recommendable, definitely NOT for business travellers! (no parking)",3

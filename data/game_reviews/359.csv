23062,Chateau Charles,"From the moment we arrived, Max (the owner) made us feel very welcome! He is a very caring host, with eye for detail, always up for a good chat and willing to provide tips about the region. The chateau itself has a wonderful location overlooking a valley. It's set on a very peaceful property but is conveniently located close to Liege, Maastricht,.. Our room was really nice, spacious and clean, very comfortable beds and a really good shower! Breakfast was excellent (and prepared with care by Max)! We've already recommended the chateau to our friends and would definitely book here again!",Nothing to dislike!,10
23125,Chateau Charles,"Arriving to Chateau Charles is like entering a fairy tale, the environment, the driveway to the castle, the lights in the orangery are only a sign of what is coming. The extremely warm welcome in the beautifully renovated historic castle in the middle of a well maintained garden. The owner and staff went out of their way to make us feel instantly at home in this unique setting. The breakfast was excellent, with a lot of fresh and organic products, freshly made jams and a wide selection of bread, coffee, tea and everything one could need. Before leaving, we already started dreaming about our next visit.",,10

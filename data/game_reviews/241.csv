12458,B&B Le Lys d'or,"Lovely! Lovely house run by a considerate and kind host. Excellent location (close to the trainstation Zuid-Midi, and next to the metro), also if one has oppointments in the European Quarter. Very good value for money.",,10

12403,B&B Le Lys d'or,"Breakfast was served in the room and was a tasty croissant and rolls. Room was eclectically decorated which I really liked. Quirky but comfortable. Rates were very reasonable for two people. Location was good for most things, but not directly central.",The bathroom was a bit tired and the shower could have done with a bit of a scrub. The sinks didn't drain very well.,7
12417,B&B Le Lys d'or,The Wifi worked.  The TV worked.  The hairdryer worked,"In my room there was a kettle, two cups and two sugar lumps.  Draw your own conclusions.  The shower was just a dribble and it was impossible to adjust the temperature to something comfortable.  The dribble was either too hot or cold then when I tried to get it hot again it took another 3 minutes for the water to heat up.  All these people are interested in is the CASH. They don't give a damn about the guests.",4.2
12431,B&B Le Lys d'or,Great location and some old charm character.  Clean bathroom.,"It is a house where a young family lives on the ground floor and rent rooms. You have to ring a bell to get attention; the lady is preoccupied with her very young children (understandably); and wants to go back to her children asap. I felt that I was intruding to someone's family and I tried to keep out of them as much as possible. There is no reception or entry.  The room is quaint but again, like an old house: the lids of the tv hanging, one has to decide either to plug the tv or the heater. The light in the bathroom is economy, so it turns on after you have already been in the bathroom. Reminded me of my parents' house..",6.3
12329,B&B Le Lys d'or,Room was really clean and with a lot of style and charm. Nice place to stay and very pleasant. few steps to metro station and restaurants.,,8.8

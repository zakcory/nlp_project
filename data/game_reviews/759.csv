18355,Hotel Koffieboontje,"The location of the hotel was absolutely fantastic. No matter where we were going, we ended up running into it, as it was so central. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and our bed was actually a double and not two twins put together. We didn't have the breakfast, but there are plenty of places around for that. I must admit that I was a bit scared when I booked it because I saw some reviews mentioning that it was rather disappointing, but my experience was that it was a great choice.","There was a delay with the check-in process, but they provide a space for luggage which allowed us to walk around and discover the city while they got it sorted out.",9.2
18930,Hotel Koffieboontje,,Room smelled badly. Inclined wall right on top of the bed's head. No blinds on the window and the curtains were very thin so the sun went through. No sound isolation - could hear everything from the outside and hallways/other rooms.,5

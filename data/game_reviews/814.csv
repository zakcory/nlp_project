3269,Hotel Montovani,"The location was good, near to the train station, nice neighborhood, close to downtown and restaurants. The hotel gives you what you need for the price you are paying, a clean bed and bathroom, is not luxurious, just a place to spend the night in a safe and clean environment. I traveled with my family, including kids, and it was good for our purposes.",Just what I expected for the price.,6
2998,Hotel Montovani,"The hotel Manager was very helpful and accomodating. The room was smaller than expected but it was comfortable and rooms were cleaned everyday, beddings and towels are replaced everyday. We booked the triple room 15.. The room was a bit on the old side but beds are soft and comfortable. The location was also very nice, about 10 mins walk from Bruge City center and you can reach every attractions by foot. Overall our stay was very nice and price was the most cheapest which is a steal given that we book on a peak season..",The bathroom needs a little improvement since the shower and the tiles looks old but its not that bad. need a little more cleaning on the vents..,8

5368,Hostel Bruegel,Breakfast was good.,"WC was outside the room even though they said it had bathroom inside, no towels and shower has temporizer, no soap or shampoo in the room. ",7
5563,Hostel Bruegel,The hostel pays attention to my specific request.  I requested for a lower bed.  They print out a paper reserving my bed in the room. Which makes me feel personalized.,"Despite the personalization,  they have make a SERIOUS,  MAJOR mistake..  I booked a bed in a 4 bedded FEMALE ONLY dorm only to find out the next morning that my room mate was a GUY.  Thank God nothing happen to me that night.  It's not about the MONEY here. It's about the safety of your clients!  If i don't mind sharing a room with a guy,  i would book a mixed dorm.  Because I don't feel comfortable and safe,  i booked a bed in a FEMALE ONLY dorm..  So this kind of error is totally unacceptable.  I don't feel safe and I feel like the property x bother about my safety issue even after I complaint at the reception.",8.3

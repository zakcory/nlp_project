23174,Van der Valk Hotel Brussels Airport,"Good location, very close to the airport and airport shuttle service was available. Although it may be helpful to extend the last shuttle to midnight. Breakfast was also good and rooms were decent","DIY hotel. You need to go down to the reception to get anything you needed Restaurants downstairs were not very flexible, and the arrangement was quite confusing. Figured out there were different restaurants with different menus right next to each other  Bathrooms starting to age a bit",6.3

23197,Van der Valk Hotel Brussels Airport,Coffee maker in room was so dirty it was not useable. When I brought this up at checkout and asked if I could grab a coffee in the lobby/breakfast bar it was laughed off. Interesting since coffee in room was listed as a feature for the room.,Little more attentive and accommodating staff,5.4
22184,Van der Valk Hotel Brussels Airport,Cleanliness of hotel and friendliness and helpfulness of staff at front desk,No hot water Driver for shuttle bus didn't turn up.

23073,Van der Valk Hotel Brussels Airport,"location is good, beds are ok.","the room had a horrible smell of smoking via the heating, making it impossible to sleep. So bad.  I mentioned it to the person who brought room service (cold tomato soup which should have been hot.) and she said she would inform reception.  never happened..  as I had to leave at 5am I just sat there and left it.  AND the shuttle does not operate before 6am.  making me pay 23$ for a taxi for a distance of only a few km.  Not to be repeated I'm afraid..   Viva Sheraton..     ps.  best to change hair dryers too when you renovate rooms.  the current ones you have are not very good. Nor did wifi or tv function properly.    its a shame, as the hotel was recommended by a colleague but I wont return.",5

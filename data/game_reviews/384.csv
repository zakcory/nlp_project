25224,CityLoft Eilandje,Room is big to feature a family with four.  Interesting decor.  Overall it's value for the price,"If there is a curtain in the bedroom roof window, may better.  Kettle need to refresh",6.3
25281,CityLoft Eilandje,Nice location,Very noisey. Could do with some basic  DIY being  carried  out.  Sheets had stains.,7.5
25180,CityLoft Eilandje,"great location,host,quirky decor.","inner front door didn't lock very worrying although the outer one to the street did but not very secure, access to the apartment through a crowded restaurant is awkward, main light switch below a socket hanging out the wall, no opening windows in bedrooms and all the sky lights being blocked off, stairs very narrow you have to walk side ways to get down them safely, toilet seat broken, several bulbs not working, annoying fan from restaurant going on and off all night, shower a bit annoying and both bathroom sinks didnt hold water as plugs leaked.",9.2
25202,CityLoft Eilandje,Lovely quirky apartment that suited us well  Everything we could want and so spacious  Places to eat  in the properties below,Our only difficulty was the stairs so would not recommend for anyone with mobility problems or carrying heavy luggage,7.5
25244,CityLoft Eilandje,Great look and feel,"We had requested a 5th bed for a child/young adult and only found a cot. We had to make up a bed on floor from cushions.
There was no hot water, no soap.
The noise from the restaurant below and bar/club next door was loud and prevented sleep",4.6
25191,CityLoft Eilandje,"beautiful loft, really cosy and in a really good location. the loft has everything you can ask for! Lots of nice restaurants and cafes! highly recommended","we asked for a late check out with the owner and he said it was all okay, but the cleaning lady wasn't really happy with this. She was a little bit pushy to get us out and said she couldn't really do anything will we were still there so in the end we last earlier. otherwise is the loft a perfect place to stay! thank you",8.3

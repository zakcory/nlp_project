24738,Smartflats Design - Meir,Very clean apartment. I could stay here for a couple days maybe even weeks if I had to. Bed was ok and very clean as well. Even the sofa in the living room was made although I didn't need it. Easily sleeps 4 ppl (2+2). I didn't really mind the stairs to the 5th floor.,"Unfortunately there were NO towels in the bathroom. Just one floor towel and one small hand towel in the toilet. So that was a bummer after the shower .. Oh, and a bottle of handsoap is not shower soap ..",6
24902,Smartflats Design - Meir,"The location is good, the room is beautiful and it have a perfect spot to take photographs of the sunset.","The 5th bed (the sofa) was terrible and there was no curtain in one of the bedrooms. There is no lift too and we need to take all the luggage upstairs until the 3th floor, where there is a cargo lift up to the 5th floor. Tiresome.
The left rooms has a lamp broken too.",9

Bath was not working after I cleaned it. Again sofa bed no sherts nothing   no floor mats bath mats. ","The apartment has not got knives folks, place was very dirty given the circumstances that it is a pandemic.  There were instances that not got cleaning disinfectant sprays etc. Kettle were very dirty. Towels was very tough ragged old towels not enough towels for 3 adults. Sofa beds didn't have bed covers sheets, nothing ! Not got spare clean sheets.  Place was very noisy when you open the front door they were not hot air conditioning or fans. ",2
24997,Smartflats Design - Meir,The location is centric,"The room was on a 5th floor without an elevator. 110 steps to climb on a steep staircase. This should have been clearly announced. Completely unacceptable for people with reduced mobility of not so good physical condition. Wifi was missing. Basic amenities. Not very clean. Pillows unconfortable. Scarcity of towels. Fire scape ladder, a real practical joke! If somebody needs to use it, it will be a big risk. Accesible only for acrobats!",3
24801,Smartflats Design - Meir,"Location, right on the Meir shopping street","Apartment was dusty not clean
No lift, not convenient if you have kids and lots of suitcases to carry. 
There were 3 nails on the wall underneath the sink in the toilet. Extremely dangerous and may cause serious injuries  if you have smaller kids crawling and playing hide and seek. We alert the management they replied saying they would send someone to look at it but no one came during our 10 days stay. 
It was very hot in the flat. No airco, only 1 fan in the entire 2 rooms apartment
Drainage in bathroom was not functioning,  bathroom was flooding every time you take shower. ",6.3

2741,Hotel Boterhuis,"It was a family room. It was nicely organised at the top of the building (two beds on one side of the room for the children, and a double bed for the parents) so it was fun for the kids and comfortable for the adults. We particularly appreciated that there was a table and four chairs in the room, with cutlery and crockery, which made our stay very comfortable in this time of pandemics, when eating out is not possible.","Probably that at the time (Easter 2021) there were some works in the street. Obviously not the fault of the hotel, but it was the only inconvenient that I can find. Also, perhaps the lighting in the room could be improved as one of the little side lamps did not work, and they were not good enough for reading. But overall it is a great place.",9

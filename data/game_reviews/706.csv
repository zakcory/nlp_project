3522,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,"We enjoyed the restaurant in the hotel, and loved the forest walks around the property. A bit unusual to book the pool but this is due to anti Covid measures. Staff was nice and friendly. the room was tidy and had all we needed incl. forest view.","Having little kids we really missed a playground or a playroom at the property, it's certainly has enough space to have one.also the position of a TV in the room wasn't great but we didn't come to watch it anyway)",9
3604,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,"Great location, spacious rooms with stunning views. Huge hotel but it feels very private and small in the woods. Great breakfast! ","Expensive breakfast (23,- a person/day) and food in the restaurants. Also a non-alcoholic cocktail for 9,- euro I found a bit too much. 
Spa was fully booked for all of the 3 days of our stay, I guess if you want a treatment you need to book ik weeks in advance. ",7.9
3673,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,Great location in the forest (ideal to disconnect from the city although so conveniently close). Walks in the forest at different times during the year are a real highlight of this hotel. Spa facilities were fine and not overly busy as we avided a Saturday to Sunday  stay.,The only two challenges I see with this hotel are: a) the facilities and services are stretched when it is very busy (such as busy pool and busy breakfast restaurant) which can be avoided by going at off peak times and b) the restaurant still struggles to provide good food and good service (especially slow); I now prefer to take the car and visit a restaurant in La Hulpe or Genval for example.,9.6
3439,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,"Location in the middle of the forest 
Comfortable room and bed
Swimming pool
Nice to have breakfast set up served in room ","No conditioner, shower cap or body lotion (strange for a 4* property)
Breakfast could have better quality products (ex: croissants, bread and cheese were quite low quality, industrial type)",8

3801,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,"The surroundings, the room, the bathroom. Food at restaurant. Staff.","Upgrade program is a rip-off: I upgraded to ""High-floor"" and that just means 1st floor :-( The ""forest-view"" upgrade gave you a limited view to a garden with some trees but than with buildings at either side. Very difficult to find the number for room-service and once you find it, they don't answer. Restaurant is good but expensive.",6
3699,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,The breakfast was fantastic,"The evening meal was over cooked and under seasoned, the bed was very hard and uncomfortable the pillows were far to lumpy, the hotel is extremely corporate and impersonal.",5

23507,Comme a la Ferme,"The location is great, pure nature and amazing views. Perfect to stay some days with family, disconnect and enjoy nature. We would repeat this expirience!","in bathroom were somebody¬¥s hairs, was a little not pleasure, but in general was clean.",8.8
23292,Comme a la Ferme,"Very quiet location, nice area to relax, 2 steps from a big and nice aqua parc",,9
23308,Comme a la Ferme,"The whole area was very quaint with the courtyards and stonework. Even though the exterior was vintage the inside was updated (thick windows, lovely shower, soft beds). The kids loved looking at the animals in the garden area. The staff were friendly.","- We were on the second floor and my husband had a very difficult time with his height. - The WiFi is available but turns off every two minutes or so, so might as well not be available. - The breakfast was $15/person and while beautifully presented, is essentially just a very large basket of bread, a soft boiled egg, and a few slices of cheese/salami. We would have loved even some fresh fruit or yogurt.",7.5

23453,Comme a la Ferme,"Very clean, beautiful, quiet, and welcoming generous hosts. Large sunny garden with goats, hogs, ducks, chickens, rabbits and cats. Good public swimming pool right next door serving decent taverna food at excellent prices. Perfect for relaxing on site; fishing kayaking biking and Durbuy nearby. A very comfy dream bed.","If you stay a few days, you may desire more variety in the $12,5 breakfast. If you are looking to go hiking, this is not the best area. ",9.2

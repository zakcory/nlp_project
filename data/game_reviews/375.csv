20120,Citadines Sainte Catherine Brussels,Very nice location,"The photos  of the appartments that appear in Booking have nothing to do with the reality. The place appears plenty but is completly the opposite. We booked an appartment for 4 adults and the space availiable was really small. For example the wall was 20-30cm from the foot side of the bed, making going to the other side of the bed to sleep  quite uncomfortable.       A few days after we booked i,t we asked for an extra bed but they never said that puting the bed in the hallway (that was the only spot it could be placed) we wouldn't be able to move around the place. Additionally it was not in the appartment and we had to ask it again (arriving late at night).      The blankets had hairs on them.",4

18623,Citadines Sainte Catherine Brussels,Great location. Nice room and the heater was very efficient!,We had two single mattresses making one. They were rather uncomfortable. The bottom cover was always misplaced! Last two days we nearly run out of hot water??,7

The location was very convenient-- right off the 16 tram. And the staff were friendly and helpful. We would definitely come back again!,,10

5310,Au fil de l'eau,"Andre is really a special person! We have never stayed somewhere with such a kind and thoughtful proprietor. You see this both in the way he is with his guests and in every detail of the property. We had a lovely room with a very comfortable bed and big bathroom, as well as access to the living room, terrace, and even a small lounge room that had a mini-fridge where we could put our wine. The entire house was spotless and full of personal touches. We also loved the surrounding area. Beautiful! We would definitely come back! Merci pour tout Andre. Vous etes genial",Nothing!!!,10

5292,Au fil de l'eau,"After a warm welcome we were presented with a very spacious room. There was very sufficient central heating and a nice bathroom with a stand alone modern shower cubicle. The bed was big and comfortable with a modern quilt but with rather flat pillows.
There's a separate little room where one can enjoy a coffee in case you don't opt for the breakfast as we did.
Unfortunately we didn't have the opportunity to communicate with the owner more as he seemed to be extremely friendly. He obviously takes great pride in his very well renovated house. ",The only thing that can't be neglected are the squeaking floorboards. They may disturb partner or neighbours on a nightly visit to the loo.,9.6
5200,Au fil de l'eau,"Very friendly and helpful owners, you book a family bedroom but what you actually get is the full house with exception to the shared kitchen. Value for money. Lovely garden, position for walking and exploring the region. Children liked the chickens, the little extra treats, Netflix. We were also forgiven a little incident with a broken object. ","The shared kitchen, but keep in mind that the accommodation is ""room only"" so you really get a lot of extras",9
5238,Au fil de l'eau,Great hospitality! Fantastic value for money! Good for visiting Rochefort or taking walks in the winter landscape!,,10
5345,Au fil de l'eau,"The family room we booked turned out to be two big bedrooms with 2 double beds, a single bed and a cot. There was also a small room with fridge, coffee & tea makers etc. We had access to a lovely terrace and a garden. It was peaceful for a real bargain for accomodation in the Ardennes.",Be aware that the toilet is accessed through one of the bedrooms.,9.2
5328,Au fil de l'eau,"A beautiful breakfast, lovely host, very good rooms. We all slept well on very comfy beds. There was a lovely garden as well as living room area that we were allowed to use.",,10

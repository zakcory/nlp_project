7571,Golden Tree Hotel,The location,The hotel is on a busy one way road with no street parking and they keep the gate to the car park closed. You have to park up the car to get a code to park the car and once you have the code you have to drive all the way round again. They should let you know before hand and maybe send you the code if you have reserved parking before hand.,6.3
6410,Golden Tree Hotel,Excellent location very near town centre and easy walk to centre. Very clean and comfortable. Breakfast not cheap but plenty of it and a good variety.,Not a lot. No mirror in bedroom only in bathroom.,8
7445,Golden Tree Hotel,Great location for walking to the most popular tour sites and the Markt Center.  Very comfortable room for families.,"The parking lot is not the greatest.  It's off a Main Street and the entrance is very narrow.  I damaged my vehicle trying to pull into the parking lot.  I would definitely recommend parking offsite.  Additionally, the shower was not very clean.  There is hair still in the drain and some of the towels were very badly stained.",6.7
7335,Golden Tree Hotel,"Instant hot water, friendly personne.",Very small bed. The walls in the stairway are literally falling apart because of mold in the plasterwork.  The doors are super old so you can hear everything on the hallway and viceversa. Also we figured the location was good but the road next to it is very noisy.,6.3

7068,Golden Tree Hotel,Location,Carpets getting fitted in main area and walkways with no health and safety in mind. No loo roll in our room,7.9
6362,Golden Tree Hotel,The room we had was spacious and clean. Our room was quiet - we didn't hear anyone else even though there must have been many other guests (since the parking was full). The parking is secure and on the hotel ground. There was disinfectant available at the entrance and the key was cleaned before receiving it.,All was good - can't comment on breakfast as we didn't eat in the hotel.,9

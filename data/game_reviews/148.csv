14372,Axis Hotel,"The hotel met my expectations. The location is nothing particular, on a main road, with easy access by car. Friendly and helping staff. The room was great, comfortable bed and pillows, nice shower and bathroom, large desk, TV, chairs and plenty of light. The room temperature was easily adjustable, and the window opens.","The room is not well isolated, it's like the walls are made out of carton! I could even hear my neighbour yawning in the morning! I had an early wake up call, good thing I had earplugs and noise reduction headset to fall asleep..",8

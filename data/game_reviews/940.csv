3629,Novotel Brussels City Centre,quality of the welcome and availability of staff very helpful staff at the gourmet restaurant: we were late and the staff accepted to serve us in the restaurant rather than restrict us to the room service,"breakfast buffet is very crammed; too little space for too many people. this resulted into an experience of foodstall (as opposed to a restaurant) quality of pillows is very bad - if there is a single thing that needs changing, pillows would come top of the list. no blanket in the cupboard (and fairly thin duvet)",7.5

3910,Novotel Brussels City Centre,The room was standard. The hotel met our request for room with bathtub. Location was good. Aircon did not work.,It was near a construction site and we requested that it was a romantic getaway and yet we got a room facing the construction side which was horrible. We could could not open the windows as it got insanely loud. I say avoid this hotel completely till that construction is over.,6

7095,Aloft Brussels Schuman,,Breakfast of 3 items is difficult to understand. The price of the food itself probably plays minor role in the total cost. So why to have this complicated system?,10

5949,Aloft Brussels Schuman,"- The hotel reception is convivial but as it is round, clients tend to stick around (downside: no discretion if you discuss your stay with the representative.) - The lobby is nice and lively, maybe not very discreet when it comes to people standing 1 foot away when you pay, the staff is friendly and pay attention to details, ""young professionals"" attitude,","- the shower is pretty small so it's not ideal when you want to relax, it also feels pretty cluttered, a bigger space with a tub would feel more confortable; - the lobby chairs/seats could be a little more comfortable but need to be renovated/renewed, the door at the main entrance is permanently locked, the sign to go around and enter through the side door makes the entrance a little less fancy than it could be.",7.5
5793,Aloft Brussels Schuman,"Have stayed there many times. I love it. But the hotel felt very empty, did not come across anyone in the lobby.",Nothing,8
6218,Aloft Brussels Schuman,"The hotel is perfect, if you had more affordable breakfast would be ideal. I really liked the room, very comfortable and with fridge and coffee making equipment. The bed is very comfortable. I found the room excellent.",I found the breakfast offer very expensive and there is nothing close to the neighborhood for coffee. Only from 10am in the morning.,9.6

5866,Aloft Brussels Schuman,"Perfect location, walking distance to Berlaymont and to place Jourdan. Large room, extra comfortable bed. There was a salsa party at the bar when I arrived. It was too tempting and I danced, but reflecting now on the situation, I regret I did.","I forgot something in the room which was not found after I left when I called. Really strange considering that was a  plastic bottle of white vinegar of a price of 0,60 EUR.",9

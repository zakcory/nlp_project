The genuine warm welcome we received and the apartment itself helped make this the best holiday we have had in Ypres, ""now our sixth year"". The apartment was spotless, and location with the added bonus of two rooftop terraces meant we had a very pleasant place to relax and unwind.",,10

Perfect  space for a brief stay  in Ypres,  a really  high  standard of fixtures and fittings + a lovely  'welcome package'  of wine,  beer and water.  Also, two  fabulous balconies which  would be perfect  for a relaxed evening later in the year!  Cold and rainy  when I visited.. I genuinely couldn't fault anything, if only  all  aprtments were as good as this!  Very much  look forward to  returning . Top  job all  round!",,10

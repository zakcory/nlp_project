19617,Hotel Old Tom,"The staff were very helpful and pleasant.  The location was excellent, right on the main square in the town.   There was parking available in the square outside the hotel (paid separately but not expensive)","The hotel is just very old and run down.  Tiny room, third floor up rickety stairs, couldn't get the tiny TV to work. Bathroom ok, but tiny. Pillows dreadful. There was a sort of window, but just looked on to buildings. This is a very budget and basic OLD place.",5.4
19261,Hotel Old Tom,"Great location, lovely patio and the staff were really great. I was travelling with my 14 daughter and the staff we're very polite and approachable.  Morning breakfast on the square was the best!","Everything met expectations.  It isn't 300-400 Euros per night, so if you book set your expectations accordingly.  Request a lower floor if you have trouble with stairs.",7.9

14216,Smartflats Design - Monnaie,Good Location,"I choose this smartflat because we were in three people and there was 2 double beds and a sofa bed (we did not want to share beds). When I arrive there isnt any sheet or blanket for sofa bed and when I call to smartflat central requesting it they said it was cost extra 25 euros. At the time,because I did not have to book another hotel I agree with extra cost but if you are going to book this flat it is better to verify all things included before go. It was assumed by flat that we were going to share beds but none of us were a couple so this extra charge should not be done",7.9
14230,Smartflats Design - Monnaie,love the place and how it closed to the surroundings!,"the heater was off for a while in our first day, and when we tried to get in the street code didn't work. we're waiting with 2 yo child for like 15 min outside.",6.7
14037,Smartflats Design - Monnaie,,"The apartment is clean and spacious, but you need to complete some shortcomings and care, such as shelves in bathrooms and hangers.  Some of the basics for the kitchen, maintenance of bathroom floor, changing pillows for the bed, setting a table beside the bed and lighting in the bedroom, in general the apartment is good and I would recommend living in it.",8
14061,Smartflats Design - Monnaie,Location is great. Walking distance from the metro and the Grand Place. There are also restaurants and shops nearby.  Lay out of the apartment is simple and yet functional. Minimalist yet modern. The lounge is also accessible. You can leave your luggage if you arrive earlier or leave later. They are also friendly and can speak English fluently.,"The sofa bed wasn't comfortable. The 2nd room by the stairs has little light. The shower can't be locked and has frosted glass, which can make it uncomfortable when you're staying with friends of the opposite sex since you can see it from the 1st room. Wifi in the room does not work, but we can still access wifi from the lounge.",8.3
14049,Smartflats Design - Monnaie,The apartment was spacious and very good access to city centre.,The noise of traffic all night long. I recommend more double glazing. Also the curtains did not cut out all the street light - slightly wider curtains is all that would be required.,7.5
14090,Smartflats Design - Monnaie,"Location.
Apartment.","Fridge not working. Requested a fix.
Was Told someone will come next day to check. No one turned up.

Told could use office fridge.

Unacceptable and unfair to travellers.",7.1
14316,Smartflats Design - Monnaie,The appartement was nice and cosy.,"Smartflat has a bad customer service.
I booked online via booking.com and I paid for my staying. 
Then two day before my staying, they contacted me through WhatsApp asking me to pay an additional cost of $ 150,00 as warranty (deposit money) 
So I had to fix that asap to confirm my staying cause if I didn't my reservation would be cancelled and I would loose my money, I already paid.
So I did everything. Now 3 weeks later, I'm calling, texting their customer service to get my warrant (deposit money) back. They not answering or sometimeS when they answer, they say that already released my deposit but I haven't got it till now. 3 weeks afters. ",1

10907,Apartment Sandpiper,Very central location to all historic sites within the town itself and not far by car/ cycle to sites outside the town. Apart facilities excellent for self catering. Bernard very helpful in getting us from train station outside Ypres after rail disruption late at night prevented us getting last train connection to Ypres. He was a delightful and helpful host and also agreed to take us to our next stopover in Dunkirk- saved us a long and cumbersome journey by public transport.,Nothing we didn't like.,10
11035,Apartment Sandpiper,"Fantastic location, everything you need for a city break, lovely and clean and a really good information/welcome book full of information about the surrounding area inc places to eat and prices etc. 
Would highly recommend but not for any one with mobility issues due to extremely steep staircase having to duck to go up and down. ","The only negative I had was the pillows there are only 2 provided which are extremely soft and thin. My husband and I took up the 2 rather lumpy hard cushions from the armchairs to put underneath the pillow which didn't make much difference only gave me a terrible sore neck by the end of the stay. 
It needs better pillows and a couple of extra in the wardrobe for those who like more than one. ",9.6

11019,Apartment Sandpiper,"Decent cooking facilities, although little room to prepare food. Good comfy chairs to relax in and table for eating at. Comfortable bed, decent wardrobe space. Good information on local activities and services. Short walk to centre.","Heating could take a while to heat up the space and then it could be a bit too warm. Steps to bedroom quite steep with no handrail one side, very awkward having to bend to avoid ceiling halfway up. WiFi often poor.",8.8

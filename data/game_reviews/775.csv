10026,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,The breakfast was very good. Excellent fresh croissants and bread rolls. Only one croissant each provided though :-(,,10
9735,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,Beautiful building and gardens,"Funny smell in the corridor on the first floor- do not know what it was, but not pleasant! 2nd floor room very hot. A shame that the restaurant was closed during our stay, we were not aware of the event they had on. Bar, we only managed to get a drink by chance. Would be good to have complimentary water in rooms and tea and coffee making facilities.",9
9744,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,"Good room, service was excellent.",Safe in room. Tea making in room would be nice,9
9698,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,Not far from the centre of Bruges. Service and breakfast were excellent and our dog was welcomed. We were able to walk her around the pretty lake behind the hotel.  We hope to stay here again,"At first we were a little worried as we had not realised that the front of the hotel lay beside a busy road, but there was no traffic noise.   Our room was a little snug - but perfectly adequate for a single night stay.",8
9949,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,,"What I realise now is that this ""hotel"" is mostly a daytime venue, with rooms available. I hadn't fully realised that when booking. There are very few facilities on site.  No clearly obvious reception, and after 6pm its not manned. Restaurant/Bar was closed in the evening we stayed. No tea and coffee facilities available in room. We returned after a day out in Bruges at around 9pm, to find the accommodation in total darkness which we found very unnerving. We were clearly one of only a few occupied rooms that evening, a really disconcerting overnight stay. Couldn't comment on the available breakfast as we did not have it.",4.6
9872,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,"A beautiful property with a truly stunning garden. Very good Wifi connection and easy parking. The location is just a short drive from the city centre and a perfect base for exploration of the city. Very friendly staff and a dog friendly hotel. You do not pay extra for your dog and breakfast is included, so the price of our stay was in fact very reasonable and we highly recommend this hotel and certainly would be happy to teturn in future.",,9.5
10005,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,"We've been several times, however this time the room was dusty, also there are no facilities in the room if you needed a cold or hot drink.",,5.5

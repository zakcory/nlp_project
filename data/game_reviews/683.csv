6119,Hotel Castel,"Brilliant location right across the road from the train station. Easy tram into the old town. Plenty of restaurants around, plus a grocery store to purchase snacks. Nice 3-star hotel with everything expected.",No 'do not disturb' sign. Cleaner interrupted me while I was sleeping off an illness and they didn't understand English. A flight of stairs up to rooms from the elevator; older or impaired travellers would struggle to get their bags into the room.,9.2
6346,Hotel Castel,Very good location if you're travelling to/from Sint-Peter's station and don't want to get into the city. Any other place is easy to reach from here as trams and busses go by the station. Nice view from rooms overlooking the square. I had a room on the street side and didn't find it noisy.,Not every staff speaks good English and I found it a bit difficult to communicate on occasion.,9.2

11791,B&B Anna's,See above.,I loved this B and B! We were very warmly welcomed! The location is great slightly off the beaten track so not touristy as other parts of Bruges are. We left out car at the free car park at Coisseaukaai and caught the shuttle bus to Anna's. The room was quite hot on the top floor but by opening a window it soon cooled down. The Vlissinghe pub nearby is very atmospheric and does great  beers. Central Bruges is a short walk away.,10

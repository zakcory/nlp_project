1464,Green Fields - Durbuy,Great experience. Good location.,"The parking lot is way too far. Takes ages before the shuttle bus arrives. We even walked back from adventure valley cos the bus wasn't coming. The tent could have been cleaner. Even though it's camping for that price we expected spotless clean def in times of corona. Dust & spider webs. Bathroom was ok though. Little outdoor kitchen would be a nice extra. After all too expensive for what you get but the glamping experience was nice.

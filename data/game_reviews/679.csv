The staff was extremely helpful in every regard.,"Streets, of course, are tight and tough to drop off luggage for folks that cannot walk from the parking garage.

3341,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,Rooms were clean and bathroom large with bath and shower. Breakfast was in the old part of the hotel and the view overlooking canal was lovely.(which is what we were hoping for when we booked the room! ) location was brilliant for all attractions.,"Some of the photo's of the hotel were in my opinion misleading..the front of the hotel was modern and our room was a ""white cube' the window was ""blocked' with a un openable blind..as it looked onto a wall..very claustrophobic not to see outside..obviously a new part of the hotel.  No wardrobe just a rail with 4 hangers but they gave more when requested.",7.5

22495,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,Location.,"Next to construction site, we were not informed of this and could not sleep at all.  There's no AC so we needed to have the windows open, which would led the construction noises -located next to the building- into the room.  Again, if we would've know about construction this would've changed but we were not told!  The facility sits under a fast food restaurant they use the same elevator as the patrons, it reeks of grease and beef, same goes for the facility.   Also please provide real pillows!",5.8

22604,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,"The open area in the apartment and his perfect localization. Close to the central station, restaurants and city center !","Well, once arrived we are surprised by an elevator which is out of service ==> 4 floors to climb, two set of stairs to reach one floor ; not that funny with our bagages, stroller and baby in our arms. (and have to do it each time you go in and out !) The common areas are not clean: sticky floors, rubbishs on the hallways and odors. The apartment is clean but needs some finishing : bathroom's spotlights hang from the ceiling, cable torn from the socket, missing baseboard .",5

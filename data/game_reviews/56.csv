24596,Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel,"I booked the hotel for my parents, while I stayed somewhere else. I like the studios in Aparthotel Adagio (I already stayed in one of their studios in Strasbourg), because they give you the possibility to put beverages in the fridge and use glasses and forks, so you feel a little bit more at home in this hotel. Everything was clean and the bathroom was very beautiful. I asked the hotel to get breakfast together with my parents and they booked and additional breakfast for me without any problems. I can totally recommend this hotel.",,8.3

2294,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Excellent central location, we were travelling by car and the charge for parking was reasonable.  We didn't have a canal side room but the view of the street was sufficiently entertaining!",Bit of a hike to get to the car park.,8.8
3419,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,It was clean and tidy and comfortable and the staff were very pleasant and friendly.,"The bath was a health and safety hazard when showering as there was no non-slip capability in the form of either a rubber mat or rough surface.  We found it to quite dangerous.
Also, the basin in the bathroom could not be use  for anything other than cleaning our teeth since it had no plug to keep the water in for washing or shaving.
Furthermore, there was no toaster at breakfast so toast was not an option.",8.3

1626,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"It was my third time in Bruges, but I never get tired of this city. The hotel is next to the Rozenhoedkaai, the most photographed place in Bruges. 
It is located right in the middle of the center and 2 min walk distance from everything !! (The Belfry, The beer wall, Choco-Story, Markt, De Halve Maan brewery..) 
The room is charming and cosy, architecture is typical Belgian, you'll be next to the canals, and the gooses. 
The staff is helpful and friendly. 
My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay !!! ","Nothing, you pay for what you get. 
A perfect trip from A to Z. ",9
2539,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Amazing location.. entire interior of the hotel has been redone so it's modern with nice big rooms, although the dining area still maintains the original interiors which I thought was lovely and rustic. The hotel is right on a canal so you have breakfast overlooking the water. Great reception staff and superb pizza restaurant across the road (and tons of other restaurants within walking distance).",,9.6

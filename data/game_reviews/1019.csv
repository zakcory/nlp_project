15825,Thon Hotel Brussels City Centre,the staff is courteous and efficient,"the superior room is spacious but the use of the space is awkward, very little space for your clothes, int the bathroom the rack for towels is just above the shelve, so they cannot be properly hanged, you get a dressing gown, but there nowhere hooks to hang them, you need to lie down on the floor to use the safe as it is just at that level, plugs are at locations useless for your computer use unless the cables become traps when you walk. The choice of colors is cold (grey and green) and the bathroom materials on the cheap side.  If you like to take part in the life on the street, rejoice, the quality of the insulation of the building allows you to enjoy the noise of the street works during the day and the sirens of police/ambulances during all night",5.8

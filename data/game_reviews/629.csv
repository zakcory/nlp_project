Good selection food/beers etc. Helpful/efficient staff","Be prepared, the hotel is on a main road although it doesn't look like it, heavy traffic a bit noisy at night, but you soon get used to it.",9.6
443,Hotel Au Prince Royal,,"WiFi signal is very weak, can hardly get connected. But staffs did nothing and even no answer to my email about the WiFi problem, if like this, I think they should not say they have WiFi.And the room rate should be recalculated. And the staff is not so friendly, while I was asking for a wine opener. I can not understand that a restaurant have no wine opener!",5

310,Hotel Au Prince Royal,Continental breakfast was very good  Rooms clean and tidy.  Location was excellent for what we wanted. Most of the staff were excellent.  Restaurant was very popular,There was four of us and we had booked a three bedroom apartment but was told this was not available on arrival. We were given two double rooms which impacted on our stay as we had to share rooms. The hotel blamed booking.com but we doubt this was correct. If the hotel can not provide the accommodation booked they should not be listing on booking.com. We did not feel over welcomed. The reception area is the same area as the restaurant counter area which is strange.,7.5

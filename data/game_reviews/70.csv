24450,Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel,"Breakfast was worth the money, room was very nice. Lobby shop had everything you could need. Very helpful and friendly, polite staff!  Nice, fresh decor.","Our room was located just on top of the outdoor which caused some noise, but the staff was very willing to change the room - we had just unpacked everything so changing wasn't really an option. The staff also talked with the guests hanging out outside, which solved the problem.  The aircon in the room was fine with the temperature control, also made it warmer. The only thing affecting the comfortability was the smell. There was a bit stuffy smell in the room mostly due to the carpet flooring. The aircon flters might also needed to check a bit more frequently.",8.3

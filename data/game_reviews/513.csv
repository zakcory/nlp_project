1647,Guesthouse Bernardin,The duplex layout gave plenty of useful space with everything you need. The bathroom was spacious with a good shower. The bed was very comfortable.,Everything was good.,10
1673,Guesthouse Bernardin,"A great standard, crockery, bathroom fixtures & fittings, comfortable very big bed!  Lovely quiet courtyard outside, which would be perfect for a morning breakfast or evening drink.  Collection of key very simple and handy too.","The stairs are very steep and narrow footing so didn't feel I could carry my suitcase upstairs.  Having said that there is nothing that the owners can do to rectify this, but its mindful that if you have a heavy or large suitcase, leave it downstairs.",10
1614,Guesthouse Bernardin,"Superb location in historical Antwerp, everything within walking distance. Charming houses built against the magnificent St Jacobs (St James) church. You're basically sleeping next to Rubens.","It's not cheap and the furniture is pretty basic. In a unique location like this, you'd expect a bit more, maybe some historical information about Antwerp or at least St James, not just the standard info on where to eat or drink.",8
1706,Guesthouse Bernardin,"I really enjoyed the breakfast, it was good value for money and it's a very nice touch that it is brought to your room.",,10
1753,Guesthouse Bernardin,"If you travel a lot, and welcome something different, the Bernardin may well end up in your favourites. It has its quirks (courtesy of the steep stairs and ultra-hip  read ""pared-down""  design, but the style is impeccable, the rooms in the courtyard ideally peaceful for after a busy day (with very appealing outside seating when the weather permits), and excellent hospitality by Stephanie and Bernard. The location is great for central Antwerp, but far from the commotion of the Meir.","A pair of hooks for the towels, please.",9.2
1635,Guesthouse Bernardin,- Proximity to the downtown (specifically the Meir) - The fact that you're basically staying in church - The private entrance - The flexibility of the cleaning staff - The ease of getting a hold of someone on the phone when you call,"- The only thing was that via email it was a bit difficult to get a quick response back.  - Be careful if you have someone old or unable to move because the stairs are very narrow, but that is only because it's a historic place. (so not really a con they can control)",9
1686,Guesthouse Bernardin,"I had a great stay at Bernardin. A gorgeous property in a quiet location, yet close to the Historic centre. The owners were more than helpful and breakfast was delicious! I would definitely recommend.","I didn't have a problem with them, but the stairs are very steep! So for anyone that has mobility issues it would be very difficult and not recommended.",9.6

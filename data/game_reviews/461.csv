2059,Faubourg Saint Martin,"From the moment you enter from the rather plain street,  you will be surprised by the romantic and stylish courtyard. My welcome by the hosts was warm and accommodating and  I was amazed by their excellent taste in furniture and decoration - all very stylish, quiet tones and with great eye for detail. As opposed to the bigger chain hotels, it is very personal and cared for, which also goes for the very comfortable rooms. I was sorry I was there for business because it would have been the perfect romantic get-away. But then, I'm sure to go back.",,9

The hosts were very kind and welcoming and even provided a small private ""dining room"" where we could have our take-away dinner and breakfast in the morning, very thoughtful and convenient during these covid-times. Definitely recommend this place!! ",,9

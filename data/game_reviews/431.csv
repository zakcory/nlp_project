Having coffee pads provided was excellent.","Apartment worn down, smelled of cigarette smoke. Mechanical noises from within the building (guess the elevator). Could not access the parking garage, unable to reach the host by phone (busy signal, phone number in the lobby was out of service) so had to street park. Extensive construction is going on on Bd.

It was really easy. The code changes with every guest, so nobody is going to enter in your apartment. The location is good, near Diamant metro station.","I needed to change the apartment after my second day because the microwave didn't work and there wasn't any casserole in the apartment to cook pasta, for example. I stay in an apartment because I want to cook my own meals and a casserole and a functioning microwave is something that I looking for in an apartment. The good part is the personal in reception who help me without hesitation.",7

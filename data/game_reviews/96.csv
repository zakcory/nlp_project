11065,Apartments Breydelhof,"The location is perfect with the fish market yards away and underground public parking at the end of the road. Received codes for doors in email, easy to access. The apartment was clean and well equipped for a short stay,",The descriptions and photos could be clearer so you know what you are getting. The two double beds are both in the same upstairs space and may not be suitable for two couples as no privacy. Worked ok for us as 3 friends though.,7.9

10839,Apartments Breydelhof,"Fab location and such a warm and cosy apartment for a family of four. After spending all day walking around Bruges it was lovely to come back to the apartment which was stylishly furnished and lovely and comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped for making a meal. It had a cooker, microwave and a fridge.","There was a problem with the shower. I think air in the pipes meant that it wasn't as powerful as it should have been. However the shower room itself was lovely and soap, shower gel and shampoo provided.",10
11167,Apartments Breydelhof,Location convenient and free bikes a nice perk,"Low ceilings and showerhead. Lack of adequate towels for out stay provided. Had to duck to climb stairs (I am 5'6""). Bitten badly during our stay by what I thought was mosquitoes later diagnosed by a doctor as bed bugs. Woken up by workmen as early as seven am on two occasions.  Workmen's tools and broken furniture left in front of our door.",4.6
10777,Apartments Breydelhof,"The apartment was very well positioned right in the center and the place was very cute, appreciated the outdoor terrace. ","It would have been great to have a couple of blankets and two more pillows. The terrace could use some maintenance. The TV was quite old, it would be nice if the apartment had Netflix or a way to connect to your own device at least. ",9

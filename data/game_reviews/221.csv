18754,B&B Kaai 16,The owners are super kind and helpful! Breakfast very good and tasty! And if you need to be up super early to head to the forest for morning photography you can either arrange for Karin to make a breakfast (or take away sandwiches) waiting for you in the fridge or make breakfast on your own. This I liked a lot!,,9.6

18715,B&B Kaai 16,"Great location-few mins away from the station and the center. Very cozy and comfortable, and nice interior! Breakfast is excellent and the host is extremely! Would love to visit once the lockdown is over and try the homemade jam for breakfast :)",,10
18733,B&B Kaai 16,"Bang opposite the station, though there is a canal in the way of the direct route - allow 6 minutes.  For those who don't know it, Halle is a great alternative to staying in Brussels - five trains an hour taking 10-15 minutes and a decent little town.  Les Eleveurs is a superb restaurant and there are numerous decent bars in the centre.  Excellent homey breakfast.",Getting in was a bit hit and miss.,8.8
18726,B&B Kaai 16,"Convenient,  clean, comfortable and a superb breakfast ",Everything was lovely,10
18719,B&B Kaai 16,"The B&B is located centrally in Halle where I was working, it's close to the shops and restaurants and just across the canal from the train station where you can get trains into central Brussels (15min) and airport (45min). 
Karin is a wonderful host, the breakfasts are delicious, and my room was very clean and comfortable. The B&B only has 5 rooms so there is a nice cosy atmosphere. ",Nothing,10

17586,Jam Hotel,the location of the hotel is fantastic and the hotel was very clean.,"We have chosen the hotel because of the location  and swimming pool.
There was no air-conditioning 
very small ventilator 
no rules to use the swimming pool during the corona.
The swimming pool was always crowded with the same people.
we have tried to enter in the swimming pool on a Saturday at 17h45 but then it was closed because there was a party.
information about the party was not given in the reception.

18916,Jam Hotel,"location of hotel, proximity to brussels city centre, economical parking charges","the room was too small, too congested for my family group of 6. The room was enough to accommodate 3 double beds, but there was hardly any space to move around for 6 people in one room. To make it worse, only 1 bathroom (toilet and shower all behind one door) meant longer preparation time to get ready. One of the most disappointing room (comfort-wise) I have stayed in.",5.5

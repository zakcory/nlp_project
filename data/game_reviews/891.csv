13124,Le Jardin du bord de Meuse,"This was an overnight stop on our journey home.  It was set back from the road into town and the garden ran down to the river. It was quiet, with plenty of parking and Chinese restaurant on site. Room was really nice, overlooked the river and was well equipped and clean. Good breakfast and staff we met were really helpful. ",Only problem was that the bed had a considerable dip in the middle.,10
13076,Le Jardin du bord de Meuse,Room was clean and heating was efficient. Bed was comfortable. Shower was quite good with choice of rain or ordinary.,Sheets too small for bed so runkled up during the night. The restaurant was a Chinese restaurant and as neither of us like that type of food we didn't eat there.  Room and bedding smelled faintly of cigarette smoke.,7
13093,Le Jardin du bord de Meuse,"A good beautifully located hotel that gave us a warm welcome and a comfortable stay, as well as a good breakfast. The location next to the River Meuse is very pleasant and there is a good restaurant attached to the hotel (which is an annexe). You get a lot for your money and access is acceptable (if not ideal) for disabled people.","One of the rooms we rented had had smokers staying in it. We had needed this room for the disabled access required by my mother. The owners had clearly made efforts to remove the smell, but this had not been totally successful by the time we arrived.  It was also difficult to wheel my mother around in her wheelchair.",9.2

13110,Le Jardin du bord de Meuse,"Chinese restaurant had excellent food with a good menu selection. Staff spoke Chinese, French and English, were friendly, helpful and accommodating.","Bed frame was old, carpet was dirty, radiator held up with pieces of wood, bathroom stank of bleach but also managed to feel dirty at the same time. Window was broken (not the glass - it wouldn't open properly).  Overall I was happy with my stay because the staff were so lovely and helpful - plus the food was delicious!",6.7
13138,Le Jardin du bord de Meuse,,"It should sound Bed and Breakfast, but not Hotel",4.6
13164,Le Jardin du bord de Meuse,"Restaurant on site a real bonus, wide choice, food tasty. Heating works to keep room warm on a cold winter night.  Showers good.","Difficult to find in the dark, sign not lit until restaurant opened. One room had good selection of TV channels, the other room did not.",7.5

25885,NH Brussels Carrefour de L'Europe,Location is very good. Room has a nice view. Staff was very friendly to give you a window view to the city on request. Excellent breakfast. Everything packed for hygiene reasons during corona times.,"This is very minor issue.  We wanted bath bubble for bath tub, but unfortunately not available at the hotel.  It would be nice to have these prior especially when there is a bathtub in the room. Also very bad wifi.",8

26172,NH Brussels Carrefour de L'Europe,The hotel was very centrally located near to the Brussels central train station and provided a reasonablly good breakfast. I enjoyed staying in this hotel although I was offered a single room instead of what I booked as they offered a free breakfast.,"I booked a double room without breakfast but was offered a single room with breakfast as they said that the room I reserved had a technical problem, so accepted to stay in a single room, which was just a good size for myself. One problem to stay in this room was smell, which was a kind of sewage smell, so I had to keep the window open all day long.",8.8
25754,NH Brussels Carrefour de L'Europe,The location was spot on. We had a large furnished balcony that looked out over the central plaza. Parking is under the hotel with lift access to the street and reasonably priced compared to other places we have stayed. There is a large train station/metro nearby although most things are in walking distance. The breakfast was very good with individualised items to guard against coronavirus,It seemed to be in need of a refresh.,8

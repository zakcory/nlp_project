7327,B&B Jadis et Naguere,"The way in which this former farmhouse has been turned into a beautiful B&B is impressive. The family room was very big, including a large bathroom. The eye for detail in the tasteful decoration in the house can be seen everywhere. You just feel the warmth and love of the owners for the place and for the guests. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful and the best part was the friendly and hartwarming conversation with the owners during breakfast. The B&B is located in a peaceful small village but close to the highway for easy connection by car to many places in Belgium. The price/quality was excellent! Would love to return in winter time to enjoy the cosy looking living room and read a book by the fireplace after a walk.",Nothing to dislike,9.6

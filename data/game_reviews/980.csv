24888,Smartflats Design - Meir,"Great location, clean, modern, up to date.","Booked apartment for 4 people but the sofa bed was not made and no bedding was left so couldn't even make the bed myself. Was a mad panic to try and get hold of the apartment so all of us could sleep.
There were no trays in the dishwasher so couldn't use it to start with.
There were no curtains in the main living area so no privacy and the sunrise woke those sleeping on the sofa bed up.
Balcony light was missing with bare wires floating on the wall.",7.9
24732,Smartflats Design - Meir,"Perfect location direct in the heart of Antwerpen, direct in the Meir. The apartment door works with a code, what makes pretty easy to check in. The apartament has great large rooms with everything we need for a short stay. It was clean and airy. It could use a bit of love though.","the apartament lacks in ""love to detail"", no sockets in the kitchen, the sofa bed did not open properly (and we needed it because we are a family of 5 and there was 2 double beds and one sofa bed), there was watermarks everywhere in the bathroom and in the kitchen.. small details that when remedied would make for a great apartment",7

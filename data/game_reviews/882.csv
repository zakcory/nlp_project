18777,Jam Hotel,Staff were all lovely aand rooftop bar was great. Also really useful having a luggage room to store your bags before you check in and after you check out!,Room was a little smaller than expected but it was still really nice!,10
17889,Jam Hotel,We liked the sleeping arrangements;  very unique design.  The hallways were too dim for my taste but everything else was good.  Very clean;  staff was accommodating.  Enjoyed the tiny pool; and the rooftop bar.,dim hallways.  game room was closed due to renovation.,8
19324,Jam Hotel,I love the ambiance!! Amenities are fabulous! A great place for everyone! It has an overlooking view of the city from the rooftop! My niece loved the swimming pool :-),"There was no air-conditioned! I was so disappointed because we visited Belgium in Summer and we were quite sweating in the room although at night it was A BIT chill (there was a small fan tho), but still it was so hot inside the room. When we opened the window for the air to get in there were some noises from the cars and garbage bins and other source of noise. I just hope the property informed the customers about this. I understand it's cold during winter, but I also hope they understand it's hot during Summer. But overall it was fantastic!",10
19298,Jam Hotel,nothing- the price we paid for for a  hotel did not meet a three star hotel expectation at all. I would never stay here again. ( please stay away). The photos shown vs reality of the hotel doesn't match too.,"-no air-conditioning for the hot weather -no fridge in the room (which is really basic) -uncleanliness of the rooms, there was still hair in washed bedsheets and cornflakes on the floor when we checked in. -no ventilation fan in the bathroom which made the room so stuffy and smelly -customer service wasn't really helpful, they were careless",2.9

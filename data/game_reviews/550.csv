18502,Holiday Village Knokke,"The location was top, we stayed at a bungalow with 2 little kids. The bungalow was small but cute. Each room had it's own shower & toilet which was a big plus. We stayed in March, the weather didn't allow us to enjoy the terras & the garden. I think in the summer it's a great place for families to stay.

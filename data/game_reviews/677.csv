3284,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"The room was spotless clean, we didn't really have any natural light in the room. Our friends had a room with a view which was lovely. Our room was very good value and we were put all day. I would chose a room with a view if I was back in Bruges. The location couldn't be better.",I would have liked a window with a view.,10
2257,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"The hotel is placed in a great position, close to every sight, in the heart of the town without letting the noise intrude it. Very comfortable, amazing architecture, especially in the breakfast lounge, which offered a magical view to the canal. Breakfast was one of the best I have ever had in a hotel. Extra credit for the really kind and helpful staff (especially the gentleman in the reception).","The glass in the bathtub is not big enough, resulting in a lot of water falling out. The room could have been cleaner. I cannot by any means describe it as dirty; however there is room for improvement..",9.6

3016,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,Staff we fabulous. View from bar terrace amazing. Centre of the city. I would highly recommend this hotel. My room was very comfortable with a lovely view and the shower was how I like it. Plenty of hot water.,Breakfast could do with more choice although what was in offer was lovely. Reception doesn't open until 8:30 am so caused difficulties checking out early.,10
1936,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,Very good location,"Only 1 sachet of coffee, 1 teabag, 1 water & no milk, they didn't give us clean mugs for the second day",7
2047,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,Room 023 was right above the river and we had a stunning view swans going past were just an arm length away. You really can't beat the hotel location.,"Breakfast was adequate and team struggled to keep coffee and buffet replenished.  But for the price you can't complain.  I would definitely go back.

Several cafes and restaurants in walking distance, and a bit further away, the centre of Peruwelz also easily accessible. Next to a large cathedral.","Slightly worn-out building, but then again, also inexpensive.",7.5
3908,hotel Melissa,"Very cheap and everything objective was fine, but with a an air of past glories - very clean, but with peeling paint. The town was similar, with a Gothic basilica opposite and the border a few metres away. It is a real throwback, in a 60s time warp. If you are on a limited budget and are tired of the squeaky clean chain hotels, it is well worth the detour.",,7.9

3950,hotel Melissa,"The room was clean and the bed, big. There were complimentary tea and coffee facilities. The Basilica across the road was silent between 8pm and 7am. The blackout curtains were effective and the large window opened wide.","My French is sub-GCSE and reception made no attempt to slow down to help me understand, despite asking. The whole place is almost derelict and has seen better days. The bar in the square below was occupied by scary looking men. I wouldn't have been happy to have stayed here on my own. There is only street parking but it is free.",7.1

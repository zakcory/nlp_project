I drink Hot chocolate milk and ate toast with cheese and ham. i enjoyed the stay. Also very close to the tourist places.","We couldnt sleep very well, because of other guests coming in the hotel in the late night. That made a lot of noise. We hear the noise of the stairs everytime. Room is not sound-proof.",8.3

Easy to remove though, and housekeeping got the message so they did not put it on again when I left.",8.3

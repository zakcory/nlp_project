16419,Parkhotel,Very clean lovely comfy bed location excellent friendly staff and a coffee machine where you can get a drink any time of the day or night also a fridge with beer and pop which you pay on checkout,Too many steps but is no fault of the hotel 1 reception guy said breakfast is to pay for and the other told me it was included in the price personally I think all reception people should know what's what the parking was a little bit out of the way from the hotel at a charge of $15 a day,9.6

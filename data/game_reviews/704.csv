3929,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,Very nice location next to the forest. We enjoyed the spa too. Great hotel.,The breakfast it's a bit expensive,10
3783,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,The area around it,It's a bit outdated. And the bedsheets wasn't clean. But most of all it's really unclear for a person who stays only for two days what you can or you can't do. Yes it's corona time. But I think it will be more clear for everybody if  in the rooms would be a sheet of paper with all the rules.,6
3875,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,The surrounding forest,"The beds were not that confortable. I woke up with back pain.
You need to reserve before your stay the massages. There were no slot available anymore when we reach the hotel.",6.3
3452,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,"Great location, in the middle of the woods. Depending on which room you get, you can have a beautiful view on the surrounding forrest. Good food from the restaurant.","The hotel is quite old, it seems. The pool and the rooms could all use some renovating. We also didn't like the carpet in our room. For a hotel in the middle of the woods, where your boots will unavoidably get dirty, this is far from ideal. The beds were also subpar, especially the small pillows and the sofa bed if you get a room for 4 guests. The food in the restaurant is good, but comes in small portions and is just too expensive for what you get.",7
3919,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,Staff was overall competent and helpful.,On our last day leaving the hotel for a connection to our train in Brussels the hotel charged us an exhorbitant fee for a taxi then forgot to place reservation with the taxi company. Fortunate our skillful drive managed to get us to our train in time.  The hotel should inform guests that they are adding a substantial charge for booking a taxi;  of course forgetting to call the taxi was unacceptable in any setting,5.8
3792,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,Location,"Cold shower and we tried at several moments.
Choice for breakfast was very limited, you have to pay extra for an egg, not even the same amount of croissants per person prepared in the bag at our table.
Food for diner was average and small portion. We had to ask 3 times to order desert and after 30 minutes wait we gave up.
We were not told that you have to book nearly 2 weeks prior to your arrival spa treatment, swimming pool slots were nearly all taken when we did the check-in, etc..
It's nice location and nice room but really expensive for the service ",6
3426,Hotel Dolce La Hulpe Brussels,Excellent quality hotel. Room service and restaurant were excellent too. Many activities to do in and around the hotel. Definitely wanna go again.,Nothing. Everything was of good quality,9

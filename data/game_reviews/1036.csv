22440,TripInn Eden Antwerp,"As the main property seemed to be full, we were moved around the corner and down the street just a short way and put up in an apartment.  This was fine - a large accommodation with privacy.","My preference would have been to stay in the main property given how attractive the photos showed the rooms to be, but I suppose that wasn't on.  The substituted accommodations were acceptable though, despite being in need of a bit of ""polishing"".",7.5
23070,TripInn Eden Antwerp,Nice staff and although there were things that could have been better it more or less represented value for money,Beds were soft and matesses slipped off the bed base. Also I had a lumpy pillow but in fairness this was replaced as soon as I notified the staff. Overall the appearance of the room was a bit shabby but it was at the end of the day a budget hotel.,7.5
22288,TripInn Eden Antwerp,"The location of the hotel is great, just minutes away from Central Station, close to everything. The staff was nice and friendly, easy check-in and check-out.","The room was next to the elevator and it was pretty noisy every time someone used it (a lot of banging noises, old elevator). No hairdryer. Rooms could be cleaner.",6.7

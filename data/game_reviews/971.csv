23891,Smartflats City - Grand Sablon,"Location was nice. Majority of most known chocolatiers has their shops almost next door ( and some of them really next door) to apartments. The nearby square is quite full of people, but location at the 3rd floor fade you away from loudness even with open windows. Checkin via email with codes of access instead of keys - nice idea.","It was stated in the description that there is not elevator, but reality with quite steep and narrow staircase was little bit ""too much"". Definitely won't recommend it to heavy smokers or similar - will be quite a challenge to get upstairs. However it will motivate you to spend more time in the city and come back to apartments only for sleep.",8.8

23794,Smartflats City - Grand Sablon,"Great location, very comfortable apartment with wonderful view on Grand Sablon.",There was a very strong vinegar-like smell of cleaning detergents that did not go away after airing the place.,8.3
23719,Smartflats City - Grand Sablon,Budget accommodation of a fair standard at a great location,"They provide a coffee maker but only 2 coffee bags. It is a special kind of bag and you need to go to Lidl to buy them. Considering a whole huge packet of these cost only a couple of Euros, couldn't these be provided? 
The table is not cosy- metallic. The cable for the coffee maker and kettle needs to cross the cooker - I was worried that I would burn the cable.
For the price, I guess it was fine. ",7.5

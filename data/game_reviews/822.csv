19798,Hotel Old Tom,,"We arrived on a Tuesday to be told that the hotel would be closed on a Wednesday, so there would be no staff, and no breakfast - which we had paid for in the room rate. I've never been to a hotel that accepted bookings and then didn't provide any services for them. The cleaner even turned the lights out on us after she left as we waited for a colleague - having woken us up in the morning by moving tables and playing the radio loudly. Nobody had even told her we were staying.",4.6
19783,Hotel Old Tom,just the localization and the wifi were ok the rest was awful.,"room was unclean and smelly, mold smell all over the place, bed linen was not sufficient, bathroom without places to put towels, and check out with nobody to retrieve the keys. Very unorganized place! not recommended at all!",3.3

19123,Hotel Old Tom,The staff and the food. Excellent,The room was tiny. The price in the room brochure was a lot cheaper than we paid.,7.5
19160,Hotel Old Tom,"Location was exceptional, right on the market square. The staff were friendly and the stay was pleasant. Breakfast was fine.","The hotel is a little dated and in need of an overhaul. It is not a quiet hotel as any noise travels up the central stairwell so early morning activity in the kitchens woke us all up at 6am.  It is priced too highly for the facilities and decor that are offered.  If it was 20% cheaper it would have received a different rating - eg an 8 or 9. That said, the location is perfect.",7
19216,Hotel Old Tom,Superb location.  Plenty of restaurants in the area.  Good breakfast.,I booked this hotel for my husband and two friends to see the war memorials.  On check in they had to pay for their room even though I had given the hotel my payment details.  As this was a present and booked on my card it was not with them.   I was not happy that they had to pay for a gift that I had given them. They said the foyer had recently been decorated but the upstairs rooms could use a facelift.,8.3

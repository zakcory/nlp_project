The breakfast was superb, and the freshly squeezed orange juice delicious! the staff were very friendly and helpful.","Parking was advertised as ""secure"" on booking.com, but when we got to the hotel it was on street parking. luckily we were able to remove everything from the car, but secure parking was one of the things I looked for when booking the hotel.",10

This is a really lovely hotel with extremely welcoming staff, stylish modern rooms, seriously comfy beds and a delicious breakfast.  The selection of artisan bread was incredible!

24157,Boutique Hotel Leuvenatel,"Good sized, comfortable room, spotlessly clean, and the cutest little balcony. No breakfast is available (as stated), but there is coffee making facilities, a fridge and a microwave in the room, and there are plenty of cafes nearby too. Good communication with the host.","You have to go up a steep, narrow staircase to get to the room (no lift). We struggled a little with the luggage. Not really a complaint, but something to be aware of for people with less mobility.",10

25916,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"I absolutely loved the location when the central train station is across the street and the center of the city is in a walking distance. People were very friendly and helpful. We needed to sort out a quite complicated issue with the payment for the room (which was about to come from the university), and the manager assisted us with every detail. The wi-fi was actually much better than the last time a few years ago. And this time we also got two bonuses -- a fridge and a scenic view on the city roofs from our bathroom :)",The wi-fi access was sort of strange. Many websites were inaccessible. There was no shower handler in the bathroom.,9.6

15325,Center Parcs Vossemeren,"Accommodation was clean and in a nice setting. Aqua Mondo was great, Staff were nice, and there were plenty of playgrounds for the kids to use.","The food served in the restaurants was quite expensive and not great quality. There also seemed to be a lot of cars on the site which made it difficult to cycle with the kids. We couldn't use any of the booking reference provided to us on the Centre Parcs APP, which meant we could not pre book any events, bikes etc. This turned out to be quite a negative as a lot of the things on offer such as rock climbing and hiring bikes where fully booked by the time we turned up.",7.5

Overall, it was good value for money.","There was no air-conditioning, and it was very warm when we visited. Could have been cleaner overall in the cottage. Perhaps nets on the windows would be beneficial to keep insects away.",8.3

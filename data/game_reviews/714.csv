12364,Hotel Du Parc,The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good and the staff was again very helpful. The hotel is a little bit noisy but it's  an authentic old UNESCO building with art deco elements and a very good art deco cafe you must visite. Next time I book the same hotel,"Little bit noisy

If I looked out and up I could see the sky FAR abive. .IT SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AS A BEDROOM IN BOOKING COM. I complained, and changed rooms after 1 night. 2nd room was normal, ok.

12573,Hotel Du Parc,The location is very good in the centre and close to the beach. It's a beautiful art deco building wit a nice breakfast room.,The rooms itself have no style and the bathroom of nr. 202 is very old and outdated. No place to put your things in the bathroom and even no place to hang a towel near the washbasin. The breakfast was refilled very slowly:a lot of food was missing.,7.1
12482,Hotel Du Parc,Location was excellent for a concert at the Kursaal  Casino and the seafront.  The double rooms on the front looked very nice from what I could see when the cleaner left the door open.,"After seeing the photos on the website I was disappointed to be given a very budget room overlooking the neighbouring wall,  Double bed was comfy but took up 2/3 room, I had to rearrange the furniture to avoid tripping over it in the night!  The hotel had an air of faded grandeur about it, but this room had faded quicker than most.",7.9

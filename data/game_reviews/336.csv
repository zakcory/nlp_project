24894,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"Very centrally located, just opposite the central station.","Parking was a very problem, we arrived at the hotel late in the evening. We were directed to a parking place. The barrier in the park opened when we took the ticket and closed when we moved behind us, but the gate didn't open so we were trapped between the barrier and the gate for about half an hour since everyone had left the parking building and we couldn't reach anyone.",7.1

25945,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,The only good things: - Beds - Location (ahead of Central Station and Parking nearby),"The guy at the reception did not greet us and we had to wait a few minutes before he started to help us. Even then he did not even said hello.  The space in the room was okay, the beds were fine and clean. The shower did not even had a holder for the shower, the shower curtain was dirty, all the buttons in the room were sticky and the heater did not work. There were only two electronical sockets.",5

24754,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"Loved the central location of the hotel. Everything was within walking distance  (train station, restaurants, shops,  etc.) The rooms were not fancy or big, but adequate for amount of time we spent in them. Price was great. Will definitely return.","The only negative thing that caught my attention were the carpets! They were very old, with some dubious stains. With the beds being very low, you could see everything!",7.9

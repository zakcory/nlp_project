15749,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,"Fluid check-in, easy to find, very nice and clean place, well maintained. professional service. Kitchen (take away in these days) was excellent ! Superb region !","relatively small room painted dark khaki green. Makes you think the walls are coming at you. We were located in the Ecuries. I'd suggest a light colour when rpainting the wall. Except for this remark, tidy, clean, bathroom very ok. I suppose it's also a matter of taste..Of course in COVID period we had to spend more time than we liked in our room during evenings..",8

16280,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,"Location was fantastic, so scenic, really beautiful grounds and building.","We were in the newer building, the was no lift up to first floor, so the cases had to go up the stairs, no issue for us however others may need help.",10
16026,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,The outside appearance of the Chateau is very nice. The staff are friendly.,"No kettle for water boiling
Parking is not convenient.",7.5
16071,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,The view from the window was great. It was quiet hot inside the room. Old fashioned lobby and everything around makes you as you are travelling back in time. The location is perfect.,"The restaurant was closed, had to look around for food in the area (there was a list with nearby restaurants given by the personel). The room was not so spacy as the rooms in the pictures. Expensive breakfast offer..",8.8
15723,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,"The use of the outdoor spa pool, sauna and mini golf was a real upside!  
The room was very clean and staff were very friendly and helpful.  ","We enjoyed our stay but found the meals in the rooms uncomfortable. I understand its covid and very much appreciated the option to buy food from the hotel and take it to our rooms. However, I was in a room with 3 people that only had 1 chair and a bed on the ground so it was awkward to eat in our beds. ",8
16647,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,"Nice room, quiet location","The set up of the castle is not castle-like, but really fit for 'mass-tourism'.",6.3

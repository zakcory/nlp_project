No air conditionin  The value of money comparing to quality of the room was not good  No uniform for the hotel staff  No view form the room, you see the emergency Steel stairs  When you remove the card from the power activitaion, it immediately cut off which won't allow you to exit the room and it's risky as you see Nothing",5.4

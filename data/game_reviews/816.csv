3437,Hotel Montovani,"Close to the city center, easily accessible, very good mattresses, friendly and hospitable personnel.","Not as advertised: on the webpage the rooms look pristine, the reality doesn't match. The ceiling showed clear signs of past leakages, as well as the quaint wallpapers, which had a yellowish tinge. Some of the light switches were missing their covers. There was no soap in the restroom, discovered only after the fact. Worst of all, the shower was full of mould, which is a tangible health hazard. On a side note: included breakfast was a selling point to me, on site we were told it wasn't included.
After voicing our complaints the management granted us a discount to be fair, but the room was still too expensive for the quality provided.",5.8

The owner was very attentive to make sure that everything was good. The staff were very efficient.",The basin tap indices were the wrong way around. The hot tap had a blue one and the cold had a red one. That was the only issue and as long as you remembered that there was no problem.,10

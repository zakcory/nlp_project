19772,Begijnhof Hotel,"The hotel was spotless, the staff extremely helpful and the room was very comfortable. The location is great. Easy walk to town and set in a very historic area.  Breakfast was excellent and the hotel made extra effort to provide food etc for my wife who is vegan. Parking also very easy and reasonable.",,10
19803,Begijnhof Hotel,This is a very nice hotel situated a 10 minute walk south of the town centre.  As a 4 star hotel the price was not too bad.  Rooms were well appointed and very comfortable.  I would return here the next time I visit.,,10
19572,Begijnhof Hotel,"Beautiful setting, amazing dining room for breakfast which is a converted coach house. Medieval buildings all around. Just stunning. ",,10
19505,Begijnhof Hotel,,Some small self cooking possibilities like warming milk at nite for children,9.6
19555,Begijnhof Hotel,Location was excellent  close to the center and still extremely quiet and it a very clean and modern hotel. There is a good bar and the garden is beautiful.,The staff cannot be considered as super helpful; one time we were not served at the bar and left while we were the only guests in the bar and the hotel is a bit boring; there is not much going on.  Strange that you have to pay for parking and usage of the sauna. The breakfast is low in value for money.,6
19447,Begijnhof Hotel,Location by the university was fine. Rooms look a little tired and could use a paint job or redecoration to a more modern standard. Far and away the best thing was the restaurant Cum Laude which has changed hands in the last 6 months. We had a memorable meal with excellent service and matching prices,Bathroom is a little outdated,7.9
19691,Begijnhof Hotel,We loved communication with the staff members! They were so helpful and nice. Thank you!,Everything was great!,10

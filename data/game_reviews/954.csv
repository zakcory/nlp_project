14560,Parkhotel,"This is the second time we have visited and have enjoyed just relaxing and strolling through de panne..The hotel does need a little attention in some areas but on the whole a warm welcome feel. The weather wasn't on our side this visit so we played monopoly in the bar with our 13year old,one afternoon he loved it! Complimentary crisps with our Belgium beers and coke. Very cosy bar area. Lovely breakfast in the morning an overall lovely stay. Xx",,8.3

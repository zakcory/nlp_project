But maybe it's my problem that I do not speak Dutch and French.. TV did not work and host couldn't get it to work either.  If you travel by car, it's hard to find parking lot. Only option was parking house a few streets away. Not  Bathroom was so small that you can sit on the toilet pot and brush your teeth at the same time.",7.9

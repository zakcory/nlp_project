8258,Hostel Bruegel,"The location of this hostel is very good, close to the city center, close to train stations, etc. The (double) room we received was very large, and so was the bathroom. At checkin we received free linens which took only a few minutes to ""install"". Towels are not free (the rent price was low, though). Breakfast wasn't very varied, but it was ok. The most pleasant surprise was at checkout, which we had specified to be very early in the morning. The evening before they offered us breakfast to-go (each got a paper bag with mostly the same items that you get at regular breakfast). We appreciated this very much.",,9.2
5998,Hostel Bruegel,My stay was excellent. The staff is great and helpful. Its comfortable and clean with a good mix of people. They also provide big lockers to ensure the safety of your valuables which is a big plus for me. The location is quite convenient too- the brussels central station is just about a few minutes walk. Lovely decor!,,9.6

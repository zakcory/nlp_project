3913,Hotel Verone - Liege Centre,The decor was lovely.,"The lighting in the bathroom was poor and there was nowhere to put a toilet bag, no shelves etc.  The room had no air conditioning so it was very hot.  There was no restaurant, breakfast was delivered to my room at 9am.  The breakfast was very simple and basic.  I had requested gluten and lactose free and both were catered for.",5

3897,Hotel Verone - Liege Centre,,"The property smelled strongly of acrid cigarette smoke. They tried to cover it up in the room with strong air freshener, but it was still terrible. Loud crashing sounds throughout the night. Cleanliness not great.",3
3936,Hotel Verone - Liege Centre,"First see comments of what we didn't like. So after overcoming the unease, the extras (in our case, a sauna within the room) was actually quite a bonus. You can book a simple breakfast for 10$ per person (delivered to your room).","It's a bit out of the way for meals (at night, especially if you do not know the town yet). As mentioned by another commenter, it would have been good if it was clear that this is hotel for couples to meet for discreetly for sex. (We were passing through & most hotels near the highway were not available. And were a little uncomfortable with the kinky deco. Of course, after overcoming the unease, everything was clean & OK)",7.5

6805,Aloft Brussels Schuman,The members of staff are always very helpful and friendly - this is the only thing about this hotel that hasn't changed over the years! They are very good at problem solving! Excellent location - extremely safe and comfortable area. well connected with metro and major sight seeing spots. It remains very close to central station. Highly recommended it to anyone who prefers not living right in the middle of the very busy center of Brussels.,Level of cleanliness has gone down compared to three years ago. There were grimes on my door of the loo and lift. Carpet started to run down. There were some dirt on the bench. Corridor and the foyer of each floor was way too dark.,8.8

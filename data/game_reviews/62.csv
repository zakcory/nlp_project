Very well equipped. So we could bring something to the hotel to eat. That was perfect. We could choose the floor we wanted to be on. The windows could be opened.","I simply don't get it that there is no person taking out the trash or changing the towels if you stay less than 7 days. When we wanted clean towels, we were helped kindly, but we had a lot of trash and it just piled up in the corner. The air conditioner switched itself off after a little while, so we woke up bathing in our own sweat..",8.3

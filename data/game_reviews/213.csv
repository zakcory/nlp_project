24017,B&B Het Zummerheem,We went to the Truck Grand Prix in Zolder. The race track can be reached on foot in half an hour. It is not a luxury hotel that we did not expect and did not book. But it is a very good family-run country hotel. The friendliness of the owners and the cleanliness should be emphasized. There are free parking spaces available and the owner takes you directly to the race track with a small bus free of charge. Thanks a lot and keep it up!,The pillows could have been a little softer.,9.2

24082,B&B Het Zummerheem,"Our rooms were clean, with table and chairs, a settee plus bunk beds. Ensuite with shower. Beautiful gardens with some amazing plants and seating areas. And a Donkey !! We were greeted by our host Marie Louise and given a list of places to eat nearby and she offered us bikes to get there as we had a problem with the car. We had a fantastic breakfast, lots of choice. Tea and coffee available all day and evening in the breakfast area. Unfortunately, it was only an overnight stay. I would have been very happy to stay longer. Our son and daughter-in-law were given a discount too on arrival as our Grandson was so young. Would have liked to explore the area but we didn't have time. Would highly recommend. Thank you for a lovely stay.",,10

3246,Hotel La Potiniere,I never recommend  anyone to the hotel  because is a hotel  for Pakistan family residential and not a hotel. Very noises during the night  Also they don't respect clients,I think as booking. Com you are just receiving commission  but you don't  value the property before  accepting the hotel  and that's what I  discovered,2.5
3231,Hotel La Potiniere,,"Payed twice for the booking.
Barely could understand each other.",5
3276,Hotel La Potiniere,Virtually nothing.  It was available at a very busy time in Brussels. The receptionist was friendly on arrival and departure.,This property barely deserves the single star rating.  Check the area out before booking to ascertain if it is acceptable for you. Vastly overpriced for what it is,2.9

3217,Hotel La Potiniere,Staff was very friendly and they all seemed to be a family. Got a free coffee at check-out.,"Conditions are extremely poor everywhere in the ""hotel"". Not clean at all. Noise at night.",4.6

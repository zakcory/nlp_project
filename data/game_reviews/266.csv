24356,B&B Sablon Antwerp,Gia was a superb host and so friendly.  The breakfast was excellent and the room and bathroom were absolutely as I would expect.,Really nothing.  The only issue was how hot it was at night but that is in no way connected to the owner as it was a heatwave.  She tried to make it better by buying an air cooler which unfortunately was ineffective but it shows the effort she went to.,10
24347,B&B Sablon Antwerp,The host was super friendly and nice! She prepared an amazing breakfast for me and my girlfriend and when we needed to store our stuff and pick them up later she was super accommodating!  The bed was also really comfortable! I would definitely recommend it and I would for sure visit again!!,--,9.6
24442,B&B Sablon Antwerp,"Perfect location in Antwerp. Hospitable host, who accommodated our late arrival. Free public parking near the B&B by the water. Antwerp is a great city!",Bathroom was outside the room (a curtained corridor to the bathroom). Room needs a bit of maintenance (loose lamps and things like that). Two separate mattresses instead of a king-size bed.,7.1

24350,B&B Sablon Antwerp,Superb host and location. Comfy bed and one of the best and diverse continental breakfasts we've had. Parking is free as advertised approx 400m along the River Schelde.,-,9.2
24344,B&B Sablon Antwerp,"The place is really nice and it's location is very central. The owners are super friendly and warm. We enjoyed the breakfast a lot .. 500 m away there is a free car park. With some luck you can get a free car park in front of Hotel Sandt. However, it's a public car park and can't be booked in advance. We would surely stay here again. :-)",,10

22919,Hygge Hotel,I booked this hotel for my parents who came to Brussels to visit me and my partner. They were very satisfied with the hotel. They loved the interior decoration of this hotel and also enjoyed the breakfast.,"They were happy with their room but just one thing that the isolation was too good that it was very hot when the window was open. (Outside was much cooler than the inside, to give you a better idea.) Luckily the hotel offered a fan but my parents told me that it was still a bit hot there. (They are Koreans who are more used to having A/C everywhere.) Plus, when they opened the window, they heard lots of car noise at night although the neighborhood is very nice.",10

23146,Hygge Hotel,"Nice boutique hotel, well located for access to the metro, Gare Midi (Eurostar) and nearby, good bars and restaurants. Room was a good size and clean.","No evening meals available at the hotel, limited bar choices - the breakfast is OK but nothing special for the money - there is better value to be had in cafes nearby.",7.9

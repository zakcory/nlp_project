13372,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel",Good location,"Not so clean, there were spider webs in the corners of the room. There was also the food smell in the morning even though we were on the third floor. ",7
13569,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel","The room was great and exceeded my expectations, the breakfast was great, too.","The only qualm I have is that when I forgot to reserve a time for breakfast, the personnel didn't put in much effort to find a solution. We were happy to sit outside, but they said it's impossible to set it up. How difficult can it be to wipe a table? I was alone with two kids and really would have appreciated a little more forthcoming in this situation.",9
13830,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel",Breakfast was good. Good location. Family friendly..,The rooms are little bit small but it's ok for a business hotel..,10
13617,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel",The rooms are functional and have everything one needs. The staff is very friendly and the location (between cathedral and yacht harbour) great to explore Hasselt.,"The breakfast was good, but not great and not fully Corona proof (cutlery in one big box for everyone to grab one. Fruit salad was taken by everyone using the same spoon). ",8
13649,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel","The breakfast was good and care was taken with regard to hygiene (wrapped food, requests to wear face masks at the buffet, spaced out tables). The room was a fair size and comfortable - just what one needs for a short stay and comfort. Very well located, near the canal, just a stone's throw from the city centre with it's shops and restaurants with easy access to some large and safe underground parking lots.",,8
13962,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel",Overall good stay though there were some dogs barking which was annoying. As some guests had checked in with their pets,,10
13970,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel","Property itself was OK with good value for money. Overall we didn't spend too much time in the hotel as we arrived late at night, immediately went to bed and left directly in the morning.","The staff during check-in (John) was very unfriendly, sometimes even arrogant. He spoke to us in a highly unprofessional matter (""ha, that's no proof, everyone can show me something like that!"" when he couldn't find our booking in the system and I showed him the booking confirmation). He also addressed us inappropriately (e.g. ""Menneke""). We really didn't feel welcomed at the property.",5

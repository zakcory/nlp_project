Too expensive for what is offered!",4.6
9891,Corsendonk De Linde,Great hotel lovely little village breakfast was superb,,10
9917,Corsendonk De Linde,Nothing,The property is far. Thank god we had a car. Restaurant is open for less then 2 hours. Rooms are very crappy. Rooms verry hot in the summer. Airconditioning does not work at night. They are shutdown on purpose to save electricity. I would not be going back.,3.8
9955,Corsendonk De Linde,"When we arrived we were tired, so it was really nice to be welcomed with a happy receptionist, who was very helpful and knew what she was talking about, the room was nice and roomy, both clean and comfortable, we wouldn't hesitate to stay again if in the area.","not much to dislike, unfortunately we arrived at 19.50hrs to be told the on site restaurant closed at 20.00hrs so we were too late, which was sad, and we thought a little early to close, but there were alternatives close by.",10
9989,Corsendonk De Linde,"The location and facilities were very good, the staff were all exceptionally helpful and nice.",Air condition was broken during our stay and that made it a bit rough to sleep during a european heatwave.,10
9852,Corsendonk De Linde,A lovely hotel with a nice breakfast and has everything we need. It was our third stay there on route from Britain to Germany. Antwerp is breathtaking.,The very noisy cockerels woke us up about 4am and didn't stop until 6am or later.,7.5
9805,Corsendonk De Linde,Lit confortable.,"Breakfast costs 11,50 and it's only cheap quality products probably from Lidl. 
Breakfast is from 8 to 10. At 9:30 they were no eggs nor bacon available. We waited a little bit and ask for more (after looking for the lady for 5 minutes). Then they said the kitchen is closed now. I complain but they didn't not proposed anything. So poor service, especially for the price of this breakfast. ",6.3

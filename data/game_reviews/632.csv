15375,Hotel Banks,"The hotel was in a great location and I have to give it to the terrific staff, very friendly and very helpful. Was pleasure dealing with them throughout the entire stay.","However, value for money was not there for me. I stayed with my colleagues for business the first night and with my partner for the second night. For a work event there is no issue as the location is most important. For a personal get away I found the room no good value for money. The rooms are far too ""minimalistic"" for the amount of money we paid per night. I would not have paid more than 75EUR for that room (we paid <100EUR)",6

14971,Hotel Banks,"very friendly ladies at reception who gave us a nice glass of cava before we entered the room. also for hotel guests you have a free open bar until 20h with lots of snacks and drinks! the room was not too big but all you need and a very comfortable bed. I did not hear any noise from outside so that's always good, especially given you are in the center of the city! would definitely book again",,9

15545,Hotel Banks,Nothing!,24/7 means open all times not the case here they shut the front door around 8:30pm and it's a nightmare to check in after! Not all the rooms have air conditioning that's a bit of a joke. No celling light in the bedroom leaves the rooms pretty dark. Breakfast a rip off. Best avoid,2.9
15456,Hotel Banks,Location,The smallest room i have ever stayed at (35 years of busniess travel).,5
15250,Hotel Banks,The room was just right - clean and comfortable.  The complimentary drinks and snacks in the evening were an unexpected bonus,Noise from the room upstairs but not the hotels fault - just inconsiderate guests!,7.1

15131,Ibis Brussels Erasmus,"The location is a bit far from the city, but well connected with metro line. Nearby eateries are less during the night which might be a hassle. But the hotel provides pizza with toppings of our choice for Euro 12.50 even during midnights. The area is calm and quiet. For people with private vehicle can visit Hallerbos during spring season which is just 20 - 25 mins away by drive. The area is very near the highway sections.",The beds were irritating. We had requested one double bed but the mattresses were in such a way that there was a huge gap between us. we had to keep pushing the mattresses all the time inside the bed frame which was a real bother in the nights.,7.5

7423,Flandria Hotel,"The rooms are rather old-fashioned, and appear to be undergoing a rolling refurbishment. Rather reminiscent of French hotels circa 1980. However, the place is charming, the staff are lovely and it is spotlessly clean. It is also very well-located, just a few minutes from the centre of Gent.",,9.2

16203,Apartment Chez Esmara et Philippe,Location is really good and the host provided a lot of useful information prior to arrival. Check in and check out process is easy. Host allowed early check in which was really appreciative since I was travelling with senior citizens and small baby.,The drainage in the shower room was blocked. Contacted the host to inform of the situation but did not get any respond. Not everyone able to have shower at the same time as it takes up to 2 hours for the water to clear. We didn't want the water to overflow the shower room so sometimes we had to skip shower session.,7.9

15750,Apartment Chez Esmara et Philippe,"It is a big apartment in the very center of Brussels. The apartment was clean, well equipped with bed sheet set, towels, kitchen towel, hygiene products. Also the kitchen is well equipped and everything is functioning. We were there with 2 adults  2 adolescents but the apartment is big enough for 6 persons, when using the large and easy to handle bed couch in the living room. The apartment is very safe: during the day there are 2 locking doors and at night 3 locking doors. Philippe and Esmara are very friendly.","At night it is very noisy, but if you close the double-glazed windows you hear almost nothing.",9

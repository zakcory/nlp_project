19655,Albert Moliere,"Can't praise it enough. Very nice hotel, comfortable room, big size bed, location is superb. Most importantly, Paul was a great host. We were given clear instructions regarding the parking and he was very helpful throughout our stay. ",The breakfast staff member doesn't speak any English so communication can be a bit challenging if your French is limited.,10
19973,Albert Moliere,"Across street from tram in a beautiful local (non-touristy) neighborhood of Brussels. Very hospitable owner family. We like staying in places with local character and this place has it, yet the rooms are modern and very clean. Good bathroom and shower; comfortable bed and linens. The price is right.","In my opinion a small change I wish for is more separation between the bedroom and bathroom, and more soundproofing, but we recognize this may be difficult for this particular space/architectural plan. It was still ok for us. We would absolutely stay there again.",8.3

19919,Albert Moliere,"Roomstyling very beautiful, Staff very friendly. We could park the car in a private place. They gave us a card so we could use public transport without fuzzing about a ticket first.",Breakfastroom is not in the same beautiful stile as the rooms are but serves perfectly for its purpose.,9.2
20217,Albert Moliere,"This B&B is located in a very beautiful house, which on its own is worth a visit. The b&b keepers are very friendly and accomodating. The rooms are spacious and modern but with respect to the old features of the house. The tram is right outside the door which will take you to the city centre in 10-15 min.","Nothing really, but if I'd have to nitpick i'd say that some places could use some extra dusting (but this was minor).",9.2

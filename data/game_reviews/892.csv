17560,Les Tanneurs,"Central, convenient location. Edible breakfast. On-site free parking was pretty convenient. The jacuzzi in our room was an unexpected but pleasant bonus.",The hotel interior is a confusing maze. Glass bathroom door with clear view into the shower from the bed - beware if you're into any sort of privacy whatsoever.,7
17966,Les Tanneurs,"The position was great, the hotel was overall clean and friendly staff.",The room interior was fairly poor (since we are talking about a 4 star hotel). The room itself was very dark with a very tiny window (basically no natural light coming in). Furnitures will definitively need a refurbishment.,6.7
17373,Les Tanneurs,the food (dinner and breakfast) was excellent.,,9
17605,Les Tanneurs,,No curtain in the bathtub - Taking shower results in splashing water all over.,8.8
17945,Les Tanneurs,"Comfortable bed, spacious room, great curtains.","The shower screen could be better fitted, so that the floor wouldn't flood every time one takes a shower.",8.8
17433,Les Tanneurs,The entree is beautiful and you can park your call easily on one of the various parking slots close to the hotel. You can walk in 5 min to the city center which is nice. Our second room was lovely and exactly what we expected.,"We booked a room with sauna and whirlpool which was written in our confirmation. Unfortunately the hotel confirmed a room only with sauna but we were able to change the room after talking to the receptionist. 
What we didn't like was the service level at the reception- we had to wait till he finished 2 calls for more that 25 min (even if we were waiting already in front of the receptionist- he picked up the second call as well). In addition we would have appreciated to get recommendations for the area eg restaurants, sightseeing etc. ",8
17806,Les Tanneurs,The property is indeed a historical building with very interesting inner architecture. The room was spacious,"There was no fan or window in the bathroom hence the bathroom was very smelly after use.  Although  it was very quiet on our floor I could easily hear the people upstairs. We got one of the rooms without sauna and jacuzzi and even in the middle of the night at 1 am I heard the noise of people upstairs in their jacuzzi. The room was also very dry, generally I would improve the air conditions system. ",6.3

5132,b room,"B room are built in a former brushes factory split over multiple businesses. Each has its own building but altogether creating a wonderful tiny secret and quite neighbourhood only 5 minutes away from historical centre of Bruges. B room is surrendered by a top class restaurant, and owner knows plenty of excellent addresses. He refurbished the whole place by himself to make it a wonderful loft in which five bedrooms are proposed. He is delighted to his visitors, breakfast he prepares is just amazing. Parking is free and located on the site. Bikes are also available. Overall, B room is the Best room.",Nothing,9

5088,b room,The building is gorgeous and the interiors are very well designed. There are plenty of areas to hang out and the bed was really comfortable. The breakfast was great (tons of options and catered very well to my vegan companion). Netflix subscribtion was available on TV and they offer affordable bike rentals. Toiletries provided were also exquisite.,"We would have liked a little more information before our arrival or during the check-in process. We had to ask other guests the wifi password, and were not really sure which common areas we could use.",8
5419,b room,"The building is extremely unique, clean, modern amenities, and well-maintained. The breakfast was excellent with several choices and particularly healthy choices (meats, yogurt, fruits, pancakes, coffee - our host even made his own gravlax that was very tasty!).  Peter, our host, was extremely friendly and talkative. We had many great conversations over breakfast and he made our stay that much better! The bike rental available on site was very helpful to get into the old Bruges city and there is free parking for vehicles on-site.",The bathroom was very clean and modern but did not have many toiletries (only basic handsoap and handcreme). Luckily we had our own soaps and shampoos/conditioners but a few more toiletries would have been nice :),9.2

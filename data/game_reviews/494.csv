12069,Grand Hotel de Flandre,Checking in was quite smooth. Nice breakfast. Friendly people in the town. Excellent food in Brasserie Francois at the edge of the square around the Cathedrale Saint-Aubain. We enjoyed a boat trip on the Meuse and Sambre rivers.,"The price was higher than expected - we had paid for only one breakfast and of course there were two of us, plus the free on-street parking was about 700m away, not 100m, so we were expected to pay $15 to stay in a multi-storey car park near the station. We took the long walk instead! Disappointed that the Cathedrale Saint-Aubain was closed off by builders' fences with no explanation. It's supposed to be one of the top attractions of Namur along with the citadel (which incidentally was difficult to find - follow signs for Terra Nova).",7

Room 308 had a good overview towards the beautiful building of the train station. ","Breakfast somewhat overpriced. Hotel interior a bit outdated, cleaning could be improved. ",8
12035,Grand Hotel de Flandre,"Big room, nice view of the citadelle, elevator, very clean, great price, air conditioning, 10 min walk to really great neighborhoods. ","Outside the hotel is a bit scary and dirty (due to local clientele). Not the hotels fault, it just surprised us. ",8

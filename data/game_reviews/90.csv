10779,Apartment Sandpiper,"The original apartment we reserved, the Sandpiper, was no longer available as the person renting it before us tested Covid positive.  The owner was quick to find a solution and offered us another apartment closer to the city at no extra cost.  The location was excellent, very close to the city and the apartment was spacious enough for two people.","I often like to make my own meals but there were no dishes available that could be used in the oven. Also, the shower was very badly constructed and the doors did not close fully, as a result while showering water spilled onto the bathroom floor .. which could prove to be dangerous if you are not paying attention and could have an accident by slipping on the wet floor.",8
10947,Apartment Sandpiper,"The apartment is ""quirky "" well equipped and well located. You need for nothing. The downstairs is open plan kitchen and sitting area with dining table and upstairs is spacious. Parking is street parking and we didn't seem to have a problem. The need to use a parking permit is normal throughout Ypres and will be explained to you on arrival. ",There is nothing to dislike about the property however the stairs are steep and take some getting used to. So if your of poor mobility you may need to consider this.,9.6

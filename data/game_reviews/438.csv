15645,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,Great location and nice staff. The chateau is absolutely stunning and the wellness area has a nice lounging area and pool.,"There was no airconditioning in the room, just a fan. With 30 C degrees outside, it was not very pleasant to be in the room. There is no minibar in the room, so we couldn't keep our drinks and food cold. The dinner in the restaurant was OK, but not worth the price. Besides this, we had a nice stay!",7

Regretfully it was only a brief stop-over for us!","Parking is a bit away from the main entrance, so don't carry too much luggage with you.. Breakfast is not really cheap.",9.2
16492,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,"The surroundings are fabulous, pure nature, quiet, fresh air.","The staff nice enough but my impression was they started with their job the day before. Not very good at managing the small details which makes a tourist feel like on a holiday.  Under our room's windows, at 7:00 in the morning some workers straded their job and wasn't quite the planned time for a holiday wake-up.  Towels not so white",6.3

18207,The Memlinc,Spectacular location in the heart of Knokke; The views from the rooftop bar are more then worth the trip. Beautiful hotel reflecting the grandeur of the past. I'm sure that after finalising the renovations this will once again be the place to stay in Knokke.  Excellent food and great atmosphere in the seafood restaurant. For fish and seafood lovers a must!,Bathrooms are very comfortable and up-to-date. AC is being installed in the rooms and further renovations are scheduled.,8.8

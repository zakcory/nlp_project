843,Avenue Beach Hotel,Room was really nice and comfortable. The road is quiet and food is available nearby. There was an espresso in the room super cool.,The sink was kinda blocked. I requested at the reception but no one cared that kinda ruined the experience a little bit because if you're paying $107 per night.. Everything has to be perfect.,7

746,Avenue Beach Hotel,"Because of a discount we got an extra large room (and a free breakfast + two extra beds). The room was comfy enough with a view of the back garden (and the fire brigade close by). Bed, shower, television and room temperature were ok. The design of the room is modern and quite clean. Breakfast had enough choices. The location is good as it is close to the beach, the kusttram, some shops and restaurants.",You could hear talking from the other rooms for part of the evening. Luckily it was quiet enough at night.,8
903,Avenue Beach Hotel,"The breakfast was amazing, with a great buffet and a bit of everything. The staff were super friendly and very attentive. It's a short walk to the center and the tramstop is just about 100 metres away. Beach is very close as well. When we return to Oostende, I will definitely consider booking a room here again.","There was a bit of dust in some corners (on power switches, light switches). Nothing major but still noticeable.",9.6

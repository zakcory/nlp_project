9622,Condo Gardens Leuven,"Leuven is a small town, so everything is easily reachable. What I liked is the fact that amazing biological zero waste shop called ""Content"" was just around the corner and in front of it there was an artisanal bakery. Really amazing combination just next door.","The sink in the kitchen was clogged, same for the shower (to a lesser extent). The shower wall was old and could be cleaned better. The worst was the fire alarm that was beeping every 2 minutes when I arrived (batteries were dead). So I had to take it off to be able to sleep. There was no hair dryer nor the iron in the apartment.",7

4093,CityHome Antwerp,"Ideal location in the heart of the old town, within easy strolling distance of the main sights. Compact, spotlessly clean apartment, in a converted old town house.",You need to be a mountain goat to get up the stairs - don't on any account arrive with anything more than hand luggage or a backpack. The automated lighting system takes a little time to become accustomed to. The owners do not live on the premises and open the doors by remote control - so you need a mobile phone.,8.8

4032,CityHome Antwerp,"The house was super cozy and comfortable, with an amazing location right at the city's historic center. Very clean and super warm with 2 air conditioning systems. The TV worked great, the kitchen was super functional and had everything one could need and the hostess was super nice and very available.","The hostess could have given us a warning regarding the running out of the hot water. Apparently, it works on a water heater or something and once, when I was going for a shower, there was no hot water. That was annoying, but everything was ultimately solved. Also, the coffee machine didn't work but that was probably just me not knowing how it worked lol",10
4048,CityHome Antwerp,"Owners very heplful, easy to contact.  Jan was there to let us in and explain how the controls worked.",Stairs to apartment very narrow and steep.  Not recommended for older couples.,9.6

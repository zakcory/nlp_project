23533,Comme a la Ferme,"The rooms were quite nice, beautiful farm style.","- The breakfast was really poor, we paid 15$ pp for coffee, 1 egg, juice and some bread and cheese/ham (and the butter and cheese/ham was really minimal).  - A lot of noise from the family living in the neighboring house and from the b&b guests.  - The reception was weird as we just picked up a letter and keys and when I sent a message with some questions the answer was that everything is on the paper.",4

23481,Comme a la Ferme,"It was very calm, the room was clean and the check in system easy (letter with key in mailbox). It was a nice romantic room. There was also a little kitchen with a refrigerator and fully equipped and even an extra bed for a child.","The room was hot (no AC), the shower was blocked on hot water (at least we couldn't change it). It was not at walking distence of Durbuy but they can't be blamed for this because I just looked for a quite place close to.. and didn't mention it had to be in Durbuy. It's not easy to find without GPS and this house number can't be found on the street (you should look for number 21..)",6.3

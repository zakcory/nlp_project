14585,Axis Hotel,Location off the beaten path.  Free parking and about a 3 min drive to erps-kwerps train station that also has free parking.  Inexpensive way to get into Brussels and points beyond.  Staff is super friendly and helpful.  Would recommend and stay here again.,,9.2

14537,Axis Hotel,,This hotel is great if you travel by car. On booking.com I searched for hotels near airport with shuttel bus. This hotel came up although it does not have a shuttle bus (only if booked through a travel agency). This is misleading. It cost me 43 Eur to get there from the airport and 37 Eur back to the airport by taxi (40 minute ride in the morning due to traffic),8.8
14452,Axis Hotel,It is close to the airport so perfect for overnight stay if you have an early flight.,,8.3
14615,Axis Hotel,Rooms clean and comfortable.,The restaurant is closed Friday Saturday and Sunday. This should have been highlighted instead of being in the small print,6.7

659,Hotel Eden Ardenne,The location of the hotel is really great next to a lake! The staff is very friendly. Unfortunately we ended up (after the cancelation due to the covid measures) in a standard room instead of the superior one with the lake view but it was definitely nice enough. Plus point dogs allowed,,9
687,Hotel Eden Ardenne,"Location is perfect,","10$ charge for a dog I think it's excessive.. poor breakfast, poor room ventilation, it's just worth the money for the location and staff friendliness",7
778,Hotel Eden Ardenne,"The Hotel is located in an old quarry area under re-development for leisure activity. The hotel building is relatively new and in contemporary in style. The area has become more popular as a holiday location for Belgium & Dutch visitors. The hotel is easy to find in Neufchateau, a straight forward drive from the motorway exit",The breakfast was 'continental' basic - adequate. The restaurant was pricey for its evening meal offer without being of exceptional quality. The reception was unmanned for long periods with slow response to the 'buzzer' alert.,7.5
1017,Hotel Eden Ardenne,Quiet room Nice bed,Reception took a long time.  Receptionist was busy doing other things other than attending guests,9.6
1099,Hotel Eden Ardenne,Great view and delicious food,Secure parking for motorbike was just the open car park.,6.3
865,Hotel Eden Ardenne,I honestly can't find anything good to say about this place. We stayed in 7 different hotels on this trip and this was the only one I wished I hadn't book.,"What a disappointment! This hotel is not fit for purpose, dirty, loud and unhelpful staff. Also a lovey view of the car park to top things off and people smoking right outside our window all through the night! Not ideal when you have a baby in the room with you. ",2.5
695,Hotel Eden Ardenne,The room and bathroom was verry nice. Bed was so comfortable to sleep-better than we have at home :P  Beautiful localisation and nice view from windows. Breakfast was delicious !,Unfortunately room in some places could be more clean. Under the bed and in some corners were spider webs..and really big ones like nobody looks there. We were with 2 children and i didnt like it,8

The bed was so comfortable and luxurious, a bathtub in the room, bathrobes and slippers,  fridge, coffee machine.  Windows overlooking Market square, it was just magical!","Honestly- nothing!  The fact that it is over a restaurant felt interesting rather than odd, unique in a great way.",10

9285,Guest House Huyze Die Maene,The location could not have been better. with being situated on the main market square. The view from the roof terrace was amazing too and the decor throughout the place was classy and had a nice touch,The check in process could have been smoother. A pointer on the site could have been helpful to ask for a certain member of staff etc as we were waiting outside the restaurant for a while after speaking to a waitress. But other than that place was amazing,9.6

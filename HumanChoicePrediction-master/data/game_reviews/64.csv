The floor of the lift was quite dirty. The variety of ham/cheese and egg dishes is quite poor, the lady is very nice though. The desk in the room is very small, for 3 Nights ok but for more?",7.1

Staffs were nice.","The hot water did not work well. We stayed for 3 nights, I was the 2nd one to take the hot shower, but unluckily the hot water suddenly turned cold after the hair shampoo for two times. I have advised to the reception staffs on the 1st and during check out. They both advised if 1st guest takes a hot shower, the 2nd guests have to wait for 45 mins to heat the water. It's really frustrated.  There are less stores and restaurants near the aparthotel, it's recommend to have the dinner at city center before returning the aparthotel.",7.5

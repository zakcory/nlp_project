16383,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,silence..,"Not only did not like, I HATE it.. Today I had flight from CRL to SAW Istanbul, I ordered a taxi from hotel to CRL Reception called a taxi, driver told me 150 Euro, did not open taksimetre and when we came to airport he said 205 Euro, I asked why, he told me that you asked a receipt He had to tell in advance, RAMADA has to work with taxi drivers WHO is not cheating their customers. I trusted the taxi driver because RAMADA reception ordered, but he lied to me and cheated. Thats why I really HATE liar & cheat taxi driver and unprofessional & untrustable reception of RAMADA experience.. I highly advice that go and find any other hotel..",3

16058,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,Nice and Cosy Room. Room was big enough. Overall it was nice hotel at the price i got it.,1. Shower Curtain needs to be changed. They are long enough so i cannot take them inside the tab while taking a bath. I kept it outside one day and most of the watch splash in the bathroom making whole floor wet.  2. There is a sign / notice about multiple use of towel in a bathroom and i wanted to use it next time so i followed the instruction but it seems the hotel management does not care about the environment.  3. Toilet seat water flow is very bad. Lots of wastage of water.,6

This B&B is located close to the centr of Ypres, just a short walk from the excellent Flanders Fields Museum, and Menin Gate, as well as close to a range of very good bars and restuarants. The property is very tastefully furnished, rooms are spacious, and very comfortable, and there is a lounge and garden sitting area too, our hosts were welcoming and knowledgable about the local area, helping us to plan our stay and get the most out of the time we had there. Breakfast was delicious. And in the current Covid time - everything was clean, all precautions were followed, and local retuarants etc also all appeared to be following proper procedures, wiht masks mandatory in the town centre.",,10

19473,B&B La Porte Cochere,"A wonderful historic building in the centre of Ypern, with beautifully decorated rooms. Each room has a unique style, ours faced the calm courtyard, was bright and had a huge bathroom. The owners offered plenty of excellent advice on take away food (due to the pandemic many places were closed) and even prepared a lovely dinner table for us. The breakfast was delicious and all our wishes could be fulfilled. We couldn't have imagined a better place to spend a night and can only recommend it.",,10

17764,Hof Van Spanje,"We loved our stay in Hof Van Spanje. The rooms were stylishly decorated, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped and well set out and we liked having different seating areas, at the dining table and in the sofa area. We could not have asked for more.","The apartment was almost perfect, the only small issue being the sensor operated hall light. This seemed very sensitive and we worked out in the end that it was triggered by people walking across the floor of the apartment above. We assume that it is mandatory to have a sensor operated light in Ghent, but if this could be adjusted that would be an improvement. But this was a small detail.",10

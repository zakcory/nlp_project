9273,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,Breakfest was nice. And nice cantine.,Mold all over the shower tiles. And it smelled so bad.,4
8753,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"Nice external courtyard on arrival, with an on-site bar overlooking.  Room was very spacious for a three single bed room and had a separate seating area and shower room. The bar was reasonably priced.  Area was quite central and easy to walk into the main centre of Brussels.","On arrival we were told the hostel arrival policies were changing and we had to check-in at the bar, which was busy at the time. But not a big deal and we were able to order a drink and check-in at the same time. Also there was a ¬£3 charge for towels. Fine as this was mentioned in the policies, but when the towels are only available during (short) reception opening hours, it was hard to ever get the towels!",7.9
9200,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,Everything was ok. The pictures look much better than reality.,"The night receptionist boy was sarcastic and not really helpful when we asked for help. The blanket sheets were not really blanket sheets, just a regular one layer sheet which was not comfortable at all and also, of course that is not good in a way of hygiene. Wifi was super bad, almost did not work at all.",6

9012,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"Nice people at the reception, nice bar with interesting beer options. Close to train station, I got an uber for 5 euro (i could have walked if I had lighter luggage)","there are stairs to get to the rooms, so you can't bring heavy luggage",8.3

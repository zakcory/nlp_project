16277,Hotel Evergreen,"Breakfast was not inspiring, but nothing is during COVID time. Arrived late and the night duty manager was very pleasant and helpful, offering me a larger room without me eve  asking for it. He also suggested I put my car in their parking space that evening, as access could be difficult in the morning.  Room was freshly decorated and exceedingly clean.","Decor, including bathroom, is extremely dated. Lack of  air conditioning wasn't a problem for me, but it could be for some guests. Steep stairs, with no elevator, to all floors.",6

15145,Charmehotel Klokkenhof,The atmosphere was cozy and the staff were very kind. We would like to work and the find a good place for as to work. They leave the key somewhere - so we can arrive after 00:00. That was really nice.,The room was much smaller than the picture shows while we were booking. Also we booked for two nights.

The breakfast was oke - but a little bit sober: no cappuccino for example.,7.1

23309,Logis Hostellerie De La Claire Fontaine,"We loved the view, the gardens and location. There are also beautiful trails/promenades starting at the hotel site.
Staff is also very friendly, great service. 
Moreover, the restaurant was great! We had an amazing dinner, seasonal and very well prepared. Absolutely loved it.","The rooms could use some freshening up decor-wise, but they were very spacious and clean.
The bathroom was minimal, with a tub and shower curtain. I prefer a walk-in shower. ",9
23482,Logis Hostellerie De La Claire Fontaine,Bathroom was obviously renovated and surprised me. Very clean and large bathtub.,"Had a room on the streetside, as the windows are single ones the noise of the traffic was very loud and kept me awake. ",6.3
23468,Logis Hostellerie De La Claire Fontaine,"Superbe garden can stay here and just enjoy the surroundings.
Walking distance (1km) to town.
Dogs are allowed and welcomed by the staff, unfortunately not by all the guests (one of the guest was pretty rude at breakfast about a dog being present).
Breakfast is very nice. Gluten free options and rice milk provided. Nice croissants and fruit salad. ","The venue is next to a busy road so you hear traffic up on tue terrace.
Breakfast is quite early from 8 to 10.
No table available for the terrace. We used the little table from inside with the lamp and booklets. ",7.9
23362,Logis Hostellerie De La Claire Fontaine,The restaurant in the hotel for dinner was fantastic! The staff were also very friendly. Great proximity to hiking and also just a 20 minute walk to town.,"The rooms seemed quite old and the walls were quite thin so you could hear guests in other rooms. For the price, I would expect a slightly higher quality. Also for the price, I would expect the use of the sauna to be included.",7
23521,Logis Hostellerie De La Claire Fontaine,"Very friendly staff, good and nice breakfast with great variation.","Hotel is located at an extreme busy street, a lot of noise at night. General atmosphere in hotel is 'old' and authentic, beds are really old and worn out, all 5 in our group had pain in their backs next day.",5

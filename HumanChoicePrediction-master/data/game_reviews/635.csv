15358,Hotel Banks,"Friendly staff, good location, outside courtyard was nice.","The room was very cold and clinical, no character or warmth, very small bath/shower and the glass walls of the bathroom do not give any privacy, it was obvious that the hotel was built on a budget, stark white lighting in hallways etc makes it feel more like an office than a hotel. We stayed in room 209 and every morning from approx 8am we could hear alot of noise i would assume from cleaning staff above us (sounded like tables or chairs being dragged over the concrete above our room, this lasted for hours, very disappointing as me and my partner love to sleep in. The bed was super soft which was not comfortable, and my partner who has allergies noticed that the room was very dusty.",5

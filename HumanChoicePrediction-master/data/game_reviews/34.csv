6844,Aloft Brussels Schuman,The hotel was in a good location with lots of accessibly transport to central Brussels. There were lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance. The bed was so comfy and the room was more than adequate and spacious. Having a hairdryer and iron in the room was handy. The staff were friendly and helpful and the bar area was a nice place to relax.,The kettle in the room smelt vinegary where it had been descaled and even though I boiled it a few times I couldn't get rid of the smell/taste. To be honest I forgot to report it to reception and it didn't in any way affect my enjoyment.,9.6

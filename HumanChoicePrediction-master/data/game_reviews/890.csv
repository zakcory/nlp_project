21921,Le Chateau de Rendeux,"Restaurant Les Caves du Chateau was very good.  Dinner was delicious and breakfast was a great way to start a busy day.  The owners/managers were very friendly and helpful.  Bathroom was large with good heating.  Bedroom decorations could use a refresh, but the chateau has lots of character and is located in a small, picturesque village in the centre of the beautiful Ourthe River valley.","Rooms were clean, but in need of a refresh.",7
21983,Le Chateau de Rendeux,The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was amazing!! The grounds were very nice and the location met our specifications perfectly!!,"There was no WIFI although site said there was.  We keep in contact with family, friends, and work via WIFI (Email, WhatsApp) and we were not able to do that nor do research on places we wanted to visit/hike.",8.8

22054,Le Chateau de Rendeux,"One of the best things about Le Chateau de Rendeux is that it has no wifi. For the duration of the visit you will be compelled to enjoy whose-ever company you may be in and you will be forced to enjoy unbearably good hospitality. We were the only guests during our stay and enjoyed one of the finest meals of our lives, attentively prepared, and paired with a marvelous wine which was recommended by our host. Breakfast was also superb. All was interspersed with engaging conversation in broken French and English.",That I didn't write down the names of our hosts so that I could thank them directly here again. I didn't like that I won't be there in the later spring or summer to see what the grounds will look like when they are in bloom.,10
21930,Le Chateau de Rendeux,The restaurant provided really nice food and excellent service.,,8

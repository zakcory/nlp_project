530,Hotel Astoria Gent,"Room was extremely spacious, spa-bath and bed were both extremely comfy after a long day of exploring Ghent. Breakfast was fantastic with plenty of offerings for the price. Staff was extremely friendly and provided plenty of information and notes on the city. Hotel itself is a fair walk from the city center, but only a few minutes from the train station and other public transport options.","Room was a little cold, and interior lighting was rather dim. By contrast, being on the first floor facing out, bright exterior spotlights shined into the windows all night. Blackout curtains are provided, though this also blacks out the morning light for those who like to wake up to it, it can be a bit irksome. Train also runs directly in front of the building, so occasionally a little noisy.",9.2
122,Hotel Astoria Gent,"nice place, quiet, with small terrace, was exactly what we needed","small cleaning issues, in cupboard you could see someone didnt clean for a while. one small issue, lack of toilet paper( funny, but we received the room with last "" pieces"". could be nice to have another roll on the side.",8

522,Hotel Astoria Gent,"We loved the fact that it was really clean, everything was out of perfection. Comfortable bed, beautiful badroom and very clean, nice lightning in the room. and close to the station from Gent (Sint-Pieters). ","I don't have many bad things to say about the hotel but the only thing me and my husband didn't like was the smokers ""room"". And I say ""room"" because in fact it was outside without anything to cover it. it was not protected from raining, cold. nothing.
Also the guarantee that the hotel takes from your credit card is really awkward. I've booked many times in different countries from Europe via booking.com and I never had to pay a guarantee before arriving at the hotel.. ",9.6
416,Hotel Astoria Gent,"Most helpful and welcoming staff. Wonderful breakfast (yummy jams). Very nice, spacious room and bathroom (huge shower). Massive bed with a Tempur-like like topper. Lovely little garden. Very quiet.","The mattress can feel very soft to some. I normally don't like soft mattresses but I slept like a baby on that one.  Beware that the hotel is close to a train station (earplugs provided), but otherwise very quiet.",9.6

2847,Hotel Boterhuis,The staff and the location were excellent. Couldn't ask for more. Parking nearby was secure though quite tight so don't expect a big car to be easy. Brilliant B&B for a walking visit of Bruges. Dog friendly as well!,,9

2730,Hotel Boterhuis,The staff was very friendly and helpful and the building beautifully renovated. Very charming. The location was perfect to explore Bruges,"The bathroom was a bit narrow and the toilet placed in the main room, separated by a door that would not close properly, which is of course due to the architecture and age of the old building - which is beautiful and totally charming (we were looking for this style of hotel) but worth to keep in mind. Covid obliged to have breakfast in our room and we took it in bed because only 1 chair was available in the room.. again, no issue for us but could be an issue for other people",8

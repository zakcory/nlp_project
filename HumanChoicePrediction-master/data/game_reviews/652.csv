3685,Hotel Boterhuis,"Overall, the hotel was clean & in a great location for all the things we wanted to see in Bruges. The staff were courteous & helpful, whatever we asked of them they were happy to assist. The breakfast was tasty with enough choice & you can eat as much of the buffet as you wanted.","For us, and this may have only been associated with our room! As a couple, we always prefer a double bed rather than two singles pushed together! However, we did not request this during our booking so there is a good chance that they would honour this request should we have made it. Also, in our room the shower head seemed to be in the wrong place & soaked the floor. Neither was a massive problem for us & didn't dampen our enjoyment of the weekend break we had.",7.5

2879,Hotel Boterhuis,Our room was right under the roof but in between other houses that's why it was very quite around and still we had nice views of roofs of buildings nearby :),,10
3220,Hotel Boterhuis,"This hotel really lived up to all its great reviews. The staff were pleasant, cheerful and helpful. Our room was large and tastefully decorated. I had asked for a bath, if possible, and this was provided (huge bath!!) It was also quiet. It was possible to regulate the heating. The inclusive breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice - including fresh fruit, cereal, and eggs freshly cooked as one wanted. There was also a kettle in the room. Only ordinary tea and instant coffee provided so if you want something a bit different take a few tea bags or whatever. The location could not have been better - a few minutes stroll to the main square. We walked to and from the station but there is a frequent bus service. All in a a great place to stay.",,10

7194,Flandria Hotel,The location of Hotel Flandria is perfect. Very near to the old center of the beautiful city of Gent.  It's a five minute walk from the parking (EUR 15 p/n) and maybe 2 minutes walking from the old churches. At check-in the staff was very friendly,"The accomodation is not very clean, smells funny and there was a lot of dust in our room. We booked a room with a large 2 pers. bed, but instead we got a room with separate beds. The separate shower looked old, a bit dirty and not very comfortable.",6.3

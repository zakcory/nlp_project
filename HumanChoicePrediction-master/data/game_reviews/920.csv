22770,Motel One Brussels,,"Very noisy, I didn't sleep all night from the street noises.. Terrible noise isolation",5.4
21507,Motel One Brussels,The location is as central as it can get. The staff were also efficient. Best part has to be the 24x7 restaurant cum bar serving customers through out and possibly the only place in Brussels catering like this perhaps. The courtyard is great as well as the lobby.,"It's quite a commercial hotel. Even though it is close to the central station, expect a trek to the hotel if walking there with heavy luggage. No tea/coffee making facilities in the hotel.",8.3
17829,Motel One Brussels,"Nice design of hotel, friendly and professional staff. Great location. Comfortable bed.",The rooms are nice but could be a bit more complete given the price. They could provide more shampoos etc and more wardrobe space.,9.6
17963,Motel One Brussels,"Great location, calm but central ","Lacking room facilities, like ware-drop, no fridge, no coffee facility, no vanity items, small room  ",9.2

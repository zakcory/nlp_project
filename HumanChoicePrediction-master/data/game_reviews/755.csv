16887,Hotel Koffieboontje,Location was incredible for the price. Adjacent to the Market Square. Couldn't get any better for the price. Great value! We never had to drive anywhere to see anything in town.,"We stayed there for 3 nights and the staff never came in to clean the room or replenish supplies (toilet paper, etc.). Not the fanciest hotel in Bruges, but we weren't planning on spending a lot of time in the room.",7

17135,Hotel Koffieboontje,The location was excellent and main monuments were within very short walking distance. The breakfast was quite good and rich.,"The room was quite small and a bit hard to accommodate a big suitcase. I was not particularly happy with some of the staff at the reception, as I received a condescending attitude when my credit card did not work (basically being reprimanded for not putting the correct password, which was not the case). Also, cleaning could be improved, as, twice, the cleaning staff entered the room but did not clean the bathroom and did not replace the shampoo/shower gel.",6.3

9864,Victoria & SPA Minsk,Breakfast was weak for a Mediterranean and Middle Eastern.. but all other is nice,,8
10244,Victoria & SPA Minsk,Proximity to Minsk Arena and Zamok Mall.,"Poor service in restaurant and particularly the breakfast buffet - no cups, no glasses, chaotic seating, food items running out and layout a mess from one end to the other trying to find cutlery. Too many external young people in spa drinking beer and dive bombing the pool. Impossible for disabled guests to use stairs in the pool. People smoking in hotel bedrooms meant tobacco smell in corridors. Gift shop closed on weekends.",7.1
10301,Victoria & SPA Minsk,"Location is ok 
Room is spacey 
Good shower","Too expensive breakfasts and not so fantastic

9942,Victoria & SPA Minsk,"Comfortable bed and room, decent breakfast with a substantial buffet, efficient staff. Wellness facilities (although I did not use them for lack of time). Good wifi.","The restaurant decoration is rather boring, canteen style. The location is not ideal for visiting, fine for business trip, but maybe not for tourism.",9
10065,Victoria & SPA Minsk,"The reception was good and fast, The room was wonderful & bug but the bed and A/C not & room service I thought was a bit weak, I love the restaurant The pasta was very delicious, I will like to Thanks Darva Zubko for help me to get fir taxi to the airport and keeping my bags to my flight, & help me to send gifts to some my friends they could not say good bye.","The air conditioning was poor, the bed was annoying and I did not rest for overnight here I think bed mattress needed to be changed. The window is good but I think it needs an insect insulator, to keep the Window open.",7.5
10131,Victoria & SPA Minsk,"Good location, spa included ",I'll repair. Several lights in room didn't work. Staff once care about money and making the guests feel like we are there for the staff. Just horrible service. They do a really horrible job and then wish to change maximum they can. It's really just crazy. They are at best a 1 star hotel. All other 4 and 5 star hotels have better service and less costly. Stay away from these evil,3.8

17866,Hotel Koffieboontje,The location is perfect. In the city center.,The bed is horrible. Not confortable.,5
17202,Hotel Koffieboontje,"The location, right next to Markt is great.","On arrival, the room was not ready at the advertised time, and I was made to feel I was an inconvenience by the reception staff.  I was even told that I couldn't expect the room to be ready for that time when the previous occupant checked out only an hour earlier.  The hotel need to be clearer with their timings online.",7.1
17290,Hotel Koffieboontje,It's location to all things,Beds too soft and pillows too hard,7.9
18341,Hotel Koffieboontje,Absolutely nothing!,"Ants crawling all over the beds. Mold in bathroom corners. Dirty shower curtain. Clogged, slow bathroom sink.  Dirty towels dirt & blood stains on them",2.5

Everything else was great! ",9.2
17531,Hotel Koffieboontje,The room provided the space we needed for our group of four and it was very close to many attractions.  The breakfast that was included in the price was excellent!,There were a lot of stairs to climb with heavy luggage and the bathroom situation was unique in that the toilet was separate from the bathroom and it didn't have a sink so you were required to go into the master bedroom every time you needed to wash your hands.,8.3
17981,Hotel Koffieboontje,We liked the closed proximity to city center but that's all this hotel has going for it.,Do not stay here! Unless your young without children and plan drink and party all night long. This hotel sits on top of a pub and its the loudest hotel I have ever stayed at in Europe. Yelling and screaming until 3am every night. The hotel itself is old and rundown. Our bathroom shower was in a different room than the toilet.,1

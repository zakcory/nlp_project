7243,C-Hotels Cocoon,Great hotel at top location. Lots of parking possibilities and beach right behind hotel. Room was perfect for our stay and special requests very well handled by staff. Breakfast was one of the best I have ever seen. Conclusion value for not so much money!,"We live in crazy times during the Corona pandemic and staff needs to maintain all safety matters for our health. It seemed the breakfast procedure was understaffed. All respect and thanks to the man in charge Geert, who kept it all going on.",9

7214,C-Hotels Cocoon,"Location was very good,  Rooms very nice and clean, Good facilities.","The pillows were a bit strange and not very comfortable, A more traditional type of pillow would be a nice option to have.",8
7190,C-Hotels Cocoon,"The location of this place is very convenient - it's almost on the seaside. If you need parking, I would recommend taking ""Indigo - Parking Zeedijk"" - it's located just over the corner (though the price for 1 day there is 25 EUR - the same as Indigo Kursaal / Centrumparking, which is overpriced from my point of view). The staff in the hotel was very friendly (both - at reception and in the dining area). Anti-coronavirus measures are everywhere and when I entered my room there was a huge bottle of sanitizer on the table. The room was clean, quite cozy, with a kettle, coffee machine, and a mini-fridge. That was a very comfortable stay and I can surely recommend this hotel to everyone.",I have nothing to complain on because everything was great!,10

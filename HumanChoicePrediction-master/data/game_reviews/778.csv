9760,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,A beautiful hotel so close to main town and carpark. Room was really nice but floor creaked a bit but what can you expect with an older building. Staff ok a good morning and a welcome would be nice as never stated in the area before. Breakfast was delicious the fresh bread and Brie outstanding.,Room was at the front no traffic noise when window shut but our room was just as you cane up the stairs and was woke a few times from noisy people. The other thing there was no kettle or tea and coffee in the room and you know us English like a cup of tea. Would still stay here again but nit at top of stairs.,7.9

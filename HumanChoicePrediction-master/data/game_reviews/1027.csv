14113,Thon Hotel Brussels City Centre,"A large modern hotel with the usual selection of facilities. We only stayed for one night as a break of journey having arrived late in the evening on the Eurostar from London. However, the hotel was clean and comfortable and very conveniently located adjacent to Rogier metro station which gives good connections to Brussels Midi station and the rest of the city centre.",,9.2

14747,Thon Hotel Brussels City Centre,"The hotel is superbly situated and looks like it was recently renovated. The room was big and the bed was comfortable.The staff were helpful. There was a cool way of mirroring your telephone/tablet to the TV, which is handy. The wifi was excellent.","The equipment is a hit and miss. I had a Nespresso coffee maker, which is OK, but it didn't work 100% well. There were no toiletries, just a basic squeeze thing for shower gel in the shower. There were no information sheets in the room (e.g. I wanted to know the gym opening times but there was no information around). And seriously, in the 21st century and at this price range you're supposed to have electrical sockets (if not USB plugs directly) near the bedroom. The socket situation wasn't good at all.",7.1
15926,Thon Hotel Brussels City Centre,"It near alot of shopping malls which is just a walking distance from the hotel. In addition, the breakfast is excellent with rooms that are spacious. The flexibility of extending checking out hours was highly appreciated during last trip",Next time offer complementary rates considering that am a regular customer at Thon. The rooms have been supplied  with compressors which are suitable for making coffee and not when one wants to make tea. Consider providing a kettle in each room.,7.5

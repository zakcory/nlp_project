9659,B&B Den Engel,"Den Engel is located in a small hamlet not far from Zaventem airport. The hamlet has a bank and a decent sized supermarket.   The accommodation was very good and the lady in charge was well organised.   Our accommodation was in what appeared to be a stables block of a 120 year old house. The kitchen, bathroom and lounge were on the ground floor and the bedroom and another toilet on the upper mezzanine floor. Upstairs was reached via a spiral staircase. The Internet worked OK and there were lots of channels on the TV. Depending on which way the wind is blowing you will hear aircraft if you sit in the garden.  But the apartment walls are very thick and you could not hear anything once inside.",,9.2

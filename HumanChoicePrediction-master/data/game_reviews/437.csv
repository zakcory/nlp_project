15895,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,"The views from the property are amazing!  There is nothing like just sitting around looking at the chateau you are staying in.  It is gorgeous to look at..  There are also plenty of things to do on the property if you have time.  I.E. pool, bikes, pool tables, walking paths and etc.  The room we had was OK, and the breakfast in the morning was just enough.","The price was a tad steep..  The photos are beautiful on the website, but we got one of the ""meh"" rooms.  The room had no view of anything, and was tucked away on the back side of our respective building.  Dinner was also something else..  As with the price of the room, dinner was expensive.  It also took over an hour for us to get our meal because it seemed like they were not ready for the crowd of folks that showed up.  ",7
15819,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,The whole area around is gorgeous! Unique place.,Smelled like smoke as the neighbours were smoking outside next to our door.,8
16150,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,"Amazing views and quiet surroundings.
Lounge area was tastefully decorated. Casual and homely yet private and luxurious. Staff at lobby were efficient and cheerful. Rooms were also better than expectations. The rates during my stay in October were irresistable. A no brainer decision compared to others in the area. ","Parking area was a slight walk away in exchange for a nice clear chateau grounds. And some effort is required to bring luggage up & down narrow stairs leading to room, especially in the smaller building. Just pointing out small inconveniences that dont really spoil the wonderful stay there. ",9.2
16084,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,"Having a bedroom at the front of the hotel, which is at the top of a small hill, we had a lovely view over the park around the hotel and surrounding woods. Especially the lounge was very cosy, relaxed and comfortable; wonderful to quietly read something with a nice drink at your side.   Good breakfast, with ample choice.","The interior of the (large) bedroom was good, but not really cosy and the lights were a bit too bright to my taste.",8.8

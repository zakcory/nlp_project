15429,Charmehotel Klokkenhof,"We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival, since the hotel was fully booked.  The room was very large and comfortable, with warming racks for the towels in the huge bathroom.  We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the hotel restaurant, which was also beautifully decorated for Christmas.  The service was friendly and professional, and the food was outstanding.  We had four different entrees, and everyone raved about their selection.  Breakfast in the morning had a wide selection of breads, pastries, cereals and hot foods, too, though they ran out of bacon and it was never restocked during our meal.","The shower setup was a little awkward, and I bumped my head on the sloped ceiling while climbing into the combination tub/shower.",10
15089,Charmehotel Klokkenhof,"Really nice well kept modern hotel with comfortable beds and clean bedroom and bathroom. staff all very helpful and friendly. we stayed 2 nights and the first day we had a heavy rain all day so we're glad there were seating areas around the hotel. did not check the area due to the rain as we were on a motorbike so not sure what was nearby. there were buses going past so could have gone to nearest town or possibly Antwerp centre. 
food was of a high standard and really nice - desserts were to die for!",regarding the motorbike there was gravel in the parking area and nowhere to secure it away from view so the only downside to a great hotel,9.6

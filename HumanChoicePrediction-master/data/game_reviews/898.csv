2952,Marivaux Hotel,"Very clean room, large room ","Although only a short walk from metro, grand place etc i didn't feel like it was in a safe area, we were two females alone and felt unsafe early evening etc   there is a coffee machine but you only get two pods per day, there is a kettle but no tea bags,milk etc    also the restaurant was closed on a Thurs for a public holiday but we were not advised of this and had planned to eat there due to not wanting to go out in the evening,  I have stayed in other hotels who have notified us of any closures if it is going to effect our stay.  We were not expecting a public holiday on a Thurs . The breakfast wasn't the greatest,  we were not asked if we wanted tea or coffee the first day and chose to have breakfast out after that",5.4
1910,Marivaux Hotel,"The room was really spacious. Bathroom was perfect. Additional towels, slippers and blankets were provided. The heating was good.",It is an old hotel so expect stains on the carpet and old TVs where you can not stick your USB stick.,7.9

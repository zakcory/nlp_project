15175,B&B Aux Quatre Bonniers,"First of all we loved the hosts. The warm welcome, care, openness and sense of freedom. The love for heritage and books. 
Second, we loved all about our stay, starting from a superb breakfast, exploring the surroundings and resting in the house. The old is mixed with new and there is a scent of an old welcoming house. A house with a character.
Third, we love the aftertaste of our stay. We keep smiling and we will return. Actually it is weird to write so much good and then hope that we will be able to find a slot to book again and bring our friends. But we need Katleen to keep spreading this happiness because she makes this world a better place. With love Maija & Jan",,10

15191,B&B Aux Quatre Bonniers,"Beautifully refurbished old house, without disturbing too much the original, the host was just delightful, gave me a tour of the house (they also have a beautiful library), the breakfast was just amazing, with delicious home made jam, bread, waffles and locally sourced cheese and ham. Since I traveled in the middle of the pandemic, Kat adviced me that all restaurants were closed, but still offered me a delicious vegetarian lasagna and a desert. I can't praise this place enough. Hopefully I'll be back in better times. 5*!
P.S. I traveled with my dog, and there was no problem to accommodate her. 
They also have a beautiful very large garden. ",Everything was perfect.,10

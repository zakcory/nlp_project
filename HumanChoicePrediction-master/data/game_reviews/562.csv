6193,Hostel Bruegel,Really clean. All the furniture has a really good maintenance. The location is great. The food in breakfast is good as well. There are a bar and a outdoor common areas where you can have talks with other people. Also it was the quiet enough to sleep well.,Warm days could be a little bit tricky there because there is not a cooler system (no other hostel where I've been has had though). Coffee could be better.,9.2

And they use card to enter the room, which is very safe. Most importantly, the breakfast is terrific! It's the best hostel I've stayed so far! And it's only several minutes walk to central station and the Grand Place.","All is good, only there is a snoring roommate, but that is hostel.",10

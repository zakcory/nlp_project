16135,Thon Hotel Brussels City Centre,Breakfast,"Small room, building under construction.  Breakfast is the best thing about this hotel, there were so many viriaties of nuts, raisons, freshly squeezed orange juice and much more, however there seems to be a problem with fruit flies, they were everywhere in the buffet area, even on food.  I think this issue should be taken seriously as its very unhygienic.  Hotel is clean.
We found it hard to move around in the room, due to its size.  It lacks lighting, no light above the mirror in the room. 
We stayed there one night and moved to another hotel near the station as we were leaving early, the other hotel was much cheaper but room was bigger, well lit and beautiful.  So very disappointed to have paid so much money for thon hotel.

While at the train station, I accessed my receipt and realised I was billed for city taxi twice which I never used;  breakfast was billed twice yet I had indicated I was to have breakfast once. Otherwise, the rest looked ok.",10

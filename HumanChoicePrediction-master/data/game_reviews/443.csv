16398,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,Dinner was fantastic. The manner of selecting wine was marvellous like I've never seen before. Dining and breakfast staff were marvellous.,"Facilities seemed shabby. Car park has a gravel surface and is some way from the building. Furniture was poor quality and looked like much of it came from a flat-pack shop a long time ago ie shaky and poor quality. Carpet in the dining room was filthy. We asked specifically for a room that we could access without stairs, but the first room offered not only had access via stairs but had no handrail. After some hassle, the room was changed.",5.8
15677,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,Location is simply perfect. Installations are ideal with plenty of activities to do. Everything was clean and comfortable and working perfectly. To recommend. We'll come back,"Staff non too friendly, but functional.
In our last night restaurant was closed, according to them to *organize the menu for the summer'. It's ridiculous that you closed the restaurant on Jul 1st for that reason. They provided a list with alternative restaurants in the area but all of them were closed, so not a good last night dinner ",9
15889,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,Fantastic location and lovely chateau. Great pool area and surrounded by beautiful parc.,The rooms in the chateau are smelly and small. Wasn't very clean. Breakfast during Covid 19 is a bag with 2 pistolets and some sides - 14$.,7
16370,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,I loved the views and the history.,This property was very nice however the staff were not the most pleasant. One new bartender was very nice however and so was the check in desk guy. Other than that they basically ignored me when I had questions for them. Also no ac at this hotel. But that's not their fault it's part of the experience. I just wish the staff was a little kinder to make the experience better.,5.8
16214,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,Fabulous location. Beautiful architecture.,"No tea or coffee making facility in room.
 Breakfast ridiculously expensive at $20 per person. 
A gorgeous chateaux. The little castle is an interesting building let down by bland, characterless rooms.

15785,Domaine de Ronchinne - Chateau et Ecuries,"Many facilities were included such as bikes, games, the spa area, mini golf and much more. The breakfast was alright, nothing special. They made sure the stay was as comfortable as possible with the current restrictions, so they set up a shop to meet all your needs.","The room we were staying in was ""newly renovated"" but sadly completely lacked any character what so ever. As if someone tried to put together a room by picking different styles from an interior magazine, trying to make it look cool and trendy but completely messing up by mixing everything. I wish the room had the atmosphere of the old buildings we were staying in. Also the road to exit the grounds was badly damaged.",8

6281,Hostel Bruegel,"Location is central, near Grand Place and Brussels Central station. Breakfast was really good, no deli meats but there were about three kinds of bread, some jams and sweet spreads, juices and hot beverages. In room lockers were really convenient and spacious. The lockers used the kind of locks they use in museums (one where you put a 1$ coin in to lock). Staff was friendly and helpful! ","The bathrooms don't have hooks or tables/stands to put clothes and toiletries on. The tissue machine in the bathroom was difficult sometimes. I didn't mind the timer in the shower, but the water pressure is really low. Room was a little small, and there wasn't any hand soap in the room (but there was a sink!) ",7.9

7229,Hostel Bruegel,The hostel was decent and had good breakfast but will never visit again. Most rude arrogant staff.,"The person at the reception was very rude. I have never felt more unwelcome ever.
To access the locker you need a euro coin something i wasn't informed about before. I did not have a coin and the person out rightly said ""we dont expect people to come here wothout money, you cant access the locker"" this was at 10:30 in the night when it was raining outside.

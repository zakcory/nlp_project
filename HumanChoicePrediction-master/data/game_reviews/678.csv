3148,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Had canal view room. Bed was huge and comfortable. Over bath shower in bathroom.  Room had fab view with windows opening right onto canal. Old building full of character and also been modernised. 
Breakfast usual continental, plenty of choice. Plumbing in bathroom gurgled a bit and was a slight smell which went away but to be expected.  Certainly didn't detract and would highly recommend. 
2 mins walk to market square and right next to beerwall. Overall would stay here again  ",Nothing to dislike.,10

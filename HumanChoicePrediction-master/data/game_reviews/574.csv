8348,Hostel Bruegel,"The building itself is nice with a pleasant courtyard. The staff were friendly. Cold water served at reception which was a nice touch. It is in a good area, and easy to reach from the Eurostar. Breakfast was fine.","We took 3 rooms for a work trip.  One of the rooms was fine, but the other two on floor 3 were effectively greenhouses / conservatories. The fully glazed elevation had two tiny openable windows. With the heatwave it was impossible to sleep in there. We managed to move one room, but two of our team had a very poor nights sleep. These rooms should be discounted, or not used in the heat as they are not habitable.",8.3
8114,Hostel Bruegel,"Good heating system, good location, friendly staff, it was ok for our needs we got at 20:00 and left at 530 morning, very basic","It's not a well kept hostel as the perfect one we were in Amsterdam (""stayokey"") the common area is poor not even water, the bed in room is shakey and the blanket and pillow low quality however the heating was good and we had a good night sleep, the windows wasn't soundproof lots of noise from the street",7.9

6247,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,"The location is pretty good, however Bruges is a small town so that does not matter so much. Bedding was okay and clean.","Since the hostel also serves as a bar, it was impossible to sleep (without earplugs) on a friday night. The staff was pretty blunt and almost rude both at the bar and at the hostel, but probably because they have to work way too much. In toilets, there were no hangers, no soaps, no mirrors etc. since they are the only private places when you stay in a dorm, you only get frustrated. No ventilation in the room, and since it's so noisy you cannot open the window neither.",5
5499,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,Staff were great. Bar is fun. Italian restaurant next door is delicious. Location is perfect for exploring Bruges. Close to the action but still quiet enough for a good night's sleep.,"The room was stifling hot the first night, but thankfully the staff fixed it on the second day because it was really uncomfortable. There was no soap in the shared bathroom. The bar's restaurant closed at 6:30 so we never got to take advantage of all the perks they offer.",7.1
5118,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,The place is super close to the center and because of covid I got a 4 bed room to myself. The hostel manager(s) and other staff are extremely helpful. They let me check out late and helped me get in the hostel when I locked myself out. Definitely recommended.,Too many people share one bathroom. No private bathroom for one room or dorm.,8

Flor is sticky. 
Poor ventilation ",7
6255,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,Location,"they offer no fans or any other way of ventilation in the room, and if you open the windows then the room gets filled with mosquitoes. No warning of it or they didn't provide any mosquito repeller or anything. we booked a twin room, the bed was ok, the bathroom was clean, the only problem was it was too hot and A LOT OF MOSQUITOES.",5

9782,B&B Exclusive Guesthouse Bonifacius,"Fabulous location right in the centre on a canal yet very quiet at night. Exceptional personal service from the owner Lynne. Atmospheric historical setting, accommodation and a fine breakfast that would be hard to beat in any larger hotel. If you like staying in something more genuine than a regular hotel (of which there are many fine examples in Bruges), this guesthouse should be on your list for consideration.",Nothing really hence excellent scoring. Only quibble was the king-size bed was oddly provided with two single duvets under a counter pane rather than a large king-sized duvet. Both duvets were poorly filled.,10

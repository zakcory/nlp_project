147,Guest house Heysel Laeken Atomium,The room was clean and beds were comfortable,"As a frequent traveler, it was by far the worst experience I've ever had with booking.com. The room was cold in late December and although my booking included heater, the owner refused to turn it on and told me I could change my reservation if I was cold! She also tried to stopped me to use the bathroom on my checkout saying that she had already cleaned it! Apart from the disrespectful behavior of the owner, the shared toilet was so dirty. The WiFi was poor and not work at second floor. I had to walk many steps down (these steps were also another issue!) to get some poor signal. It is not value for money at all. I honestly believe such an awful property should never be listed in booking.com.",3

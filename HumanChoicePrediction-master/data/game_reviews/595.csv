21252,Hotel 't Putje,The location of the hotel is ideal. Being in the outskirts of the centre of town means that it's very easy to get around. It's a 10 minute walk from the train station and also 10 min away from the main tourist attractions. There are also plenty of lovely restaurants and cafes nearby. The staff members went out of their way to make my stay pleasant. The room was lovely and clean. The bed was so comfy that I snoozed my alarm 2 times in the morning before I finally got up.,The building is showing its age - the facilities are a bit old but nonetheless clean and in a good state. My room was a bit chilly overnight but the duvet was very warm.,9.6

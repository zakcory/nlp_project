12010,NH Brussels EU Berlaymont,"I selected the hotel based on the location, close to museums. It was excellent!! The two main museums are at short walk distance. There are good places to have good and cheaper breakfast nearbuy, just a few blocks from the museums.",I didn't like that you need to ring a bell to have the door opened for you even arriving relatively early in the evening. Sometimes the front desk girl is busy doing another thing and you need to wait out in the cold until she decides to pay attention to you and open the door. I think that a mechanism where you use your room key to open the door might not be difficult to implement.,8.3

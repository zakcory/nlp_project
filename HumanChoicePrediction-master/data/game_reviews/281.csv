4704,B&B Ter Vesten,Good location. Lovely deck to sit out and relax. Great breakfast.,"Room and bathroom were smaller than  expected from pictures. Parking a bit of a hassle as it is three hours only on the street during the day. We're told we could park at the small mall next door but when we asked they said only when we were shopping there and the manager was fed up with the B&B telling people they could park there. They also lock the gate at 6 pm so if you haven't moved your car you are out of luck.

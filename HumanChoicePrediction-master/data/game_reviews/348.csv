5940,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,Good location.,"Unfriendly staff. Rude while welcoming, and promised to have someone in the reception desk next morning at 6.00 am for my check out. I waited there until 6.10 am and no one was there, and I needed to leave to take a bus. Therefore, I did not get my $5 euro key-deposit back. They took long hours to finally take my phone call, and after 2 days insisting, they told me to send a mail. I did, and they can only deposit the money into a european bank account. They haven't done it yet, after a week, and even if they do, I would not recommend this place. Too many problems for just 1 night there. On top of that, they have no lift, and the bed was pretty bad.",5.4

6184,Charlie Rockets Youth Hostel,Location.,"I booked 2 beds in a shared room and one of the beds was a really small mattress directly on the floor.
Moreover, even though I paid for our stay beforehand through the app, they made us pay a 'city tax' (around $5). It was kind of suspicious.",4.6

627,Hotel Eden Ardenne,"The location is perfect, a lot of places to walk around. The hotel is easy to be found, the staff is more than helpful, the room was spacious enough for that type of hotels, was very clean and the bathroom had everything we needed. looking forward to going again once the covid restrictions are off.",nothing to declare :),8
791,Hotel Eden Ardenne,On our first visit in August we were given an upgrade to a wonderfully large room set on split levels which was perfect for an adult with teenager. On our second visit we booked a double/twin room which was also very comfortable with a lovely view of the lake. It would be nice to have access to a kettle so that guests can make themselves a hot drink before bed but apart from this our stay was marvellous.,It would be nice to have access to a kettle so that guests can make themselves a hot drink before bed and perhaps some complimentary water as offered by most hotels.,9.2
813,Hotel Eden Ardenne,Excellent location with terrace overlooking the lake. We booked a double room and a triple for a party of 5 (3 adults/2 children); both rooms were a good size with excellent shower. Open shelves so we did not risk leaving anything behind in cupboards. Restaurant was good with a decent children's menu.,Reception guy didn't tell us where the room was. It was room 16 so we walked upstairs to the first floor but those rooms were 20+ so we had to walk back down past the reception desk along a corridor. The guy on reception kept his head down.. Very strange.,8.3
733,Hotel Eden Ardenne,"Great location, nice personnel, perfect view (choose option with the lake view!)","Bugs in the room (not a problem but not nice either), not crispy bed linen",8.8
591,Hotel Eden Ardenne,Beautiful view from your room of the lake and forest. Due to covid we had our meals in our room. Food was very good. Staff very helpful and friendly. Room was nice and clean.,The shower in the bathroom was open so water got everywhere so had a wet floor after we used each time.,8
896,Hotel Eden Ardenne,,Floors in public areas and rooms were not clean.,5.4
938,Hotel Eden Ardenne,The location of the hotel was excellent overlooking the new Park and lake and if you had a room on that side it would have been good,"Although pets were accepted, it seemed that they were not welcome. Pets were not allowed into the restaurant or breakfast room and had it been wet or cold sitting outside would not have been an option. Also, we had a room at the front which abutted the car park. As the hotel is not air-conditioned it meant that we had to have the window open Because of the room's location, if people were smoking in the car park the smoke wafted into the room. Although the restaurant was open there were no menus in Reception and you couldn't have a meal unless you booked in Reception",5.8

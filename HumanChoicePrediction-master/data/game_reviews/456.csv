14697,EXIT 29,the ease of access to the motorway,the staff were unhelpful in the extreme  the breakfast was meagre and had no resemblance whatsoever to the pictures on Booking.com,4
14707,EXIT 29,very good location  to stop on the way to Germany or Italy,The Staff was horrid  continental breakfast was meagre   no restaurant nearby so we had dinner expensive and bed,4
14744,EXIT 29,Conveniently located in a truck stop on a motorway junction. Clean bed linen. Breakfast just ok with good coffee.,"Bathroom stank of stale cigarette smoke - had to sleep with the window open when it was snowing outside - unacceptable to a non-smoker that the 'hotel' has not rectified this. Rooms basic and small in the basement - bed is ok but not particularly comfortable. Looks superficially clean, but actually is not. Check in is at the cafeteria till - no staff present at this till on arrival. Stood around waiting - then told that I must book via the internet before I could check in, even though I had already booked via this website. This is a truck stop motel and not a hotel. Not recommended for anyone other than truckers.",4
14755,EXIT 29,clear,"Very noisy. On booking.com this appeared as a hotel, while in reality it is a motel for truckdrivers. No cup in the room to drink some water.",4.6
14543,EXIT 29,"Very handy for the motorway, typical continental breakfast.","Signage to the hotel could be better, a wider range of TV channels would be an advantage, as would coffee-making facilities.",7

16268,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,Not that i can say much about it,"Scruffy and it looks nowhere near a 4* hotel and for the price that we paid. It cannot be considered as a Business hotel.
I will not recommend to any business travellers!!!",5
16557,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,,"Basically everything. There is not window in the room, you can't have fresh air There is no minibar in the room which is crucial in such isolated area. Staff is not helpful  The room is not well equiped",2.9
16217,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,"The location is not central, but it was ok for me. The staff was helpful and agreed to change my room, as the one they gave me first had a noisy airco unit.","The airco was better but also a bit noisy in the second room, and could not be set to a comfortable temperature / fan level, and I had to be switch it off during the night so I could sleep (and this was during the record heat wave in late July). Also the pillows were not great (one was too thin and two were too thick).",7.1
16097,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,Staff is friendly,"Facility is basic, location is not good, nothing around  and the hotel reserved 150 euro for security deposit while there is no even bar in the room. First time I see that the hotel such big amount for security deposit, which return only after 2 weeks from departure. 
Breakfast is average but costs 19 euro.
Overall the hotel is 3 star, basic",6.3
16043,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,very good place for the price,"I think there are some impermeable sheet under the normal sheet that's why the bed could not ""breathe"" and I was sweatening at night. Also, when you are taking shower, it is too dark because the light is only on the other side of curtain",8
16478,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,Very big room.,Very bad personnel behaviour. The receptionist was very impolite and rude. The food at the restaurant was disgusting. The hamburger was burned outside and raw inside!  Terrible experience! I will never come back in this hotel.,3

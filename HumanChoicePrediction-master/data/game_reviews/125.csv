1804,Art de Sejour - B&B,"The hotel was immaculately clean, quiet, and comfortable. Mario was a wonderful host and made a delicious breakfast for us. We have been used to breakfasts where guests help/serve themselves but this was a nice touch to have a host serve. Mario offered us a map for orientation to walk around the area and find landmarks and also provided a list of some recommended restaurants. We had a great stay at Art de Sejour!",,10
2220,Art de Sejour - B&B,"Where to start?   Tea and coffee at check in with Ivan.   Personalized map of recommended restaurants, awesome room with a heavenly shower ( this was the third establishment we stayed at.. wish we could have spent more time here).  And breakfast..Mario started us with blueberry banana smoothie as a breakfast hors d'≈ìuvre, croissants, yogurt and fruit.   And although I shouldn't have, I had the smoke salmon too.   By far out favorite place.  We felt totally pampered.  And the dogs, if you're lucky enough to meet them, are adorable.",That our stay was so short,10
1912,Art de Sejour - B&B,"Loved the feeling of total privacy, yet knowing there was someone there to help you if need be. Everything was well thought out - from the coffee maker to the roomy, spotless decor, and warm lighting. It was wonderful to wake up to the aroma of rolls and croissants baking downstairs!  Would highly recommend this all my friends.",Nothing,10

2653,Art de Sejour - B&B,"This was by far the best stay we've ever had in Brussels. Traveling for work with a group of people of different ages and nationalities, and everyone agreed on this. Everything was perfect - the rooms were super spacious, comfortable and beautifully decorated to very last detail, breakfast was varied, all fresh, natural and delicious, and the host was amazing! Location very convenient, close to major attractions and with a variety of bars and restaurants close by. We will definitely try to stay here again on our next visit. Congratulations to the host for an excellent job.",,10
2525,Art de Sejour - B&B,"Amazing, super-friendly host - Nothing is too much trouble. Excellent value for money. A fabulous hotel in the heart of Brussels - A stone's throw from the Grand Place & Manneken Pis. Would highly recommend this little gem!",,10

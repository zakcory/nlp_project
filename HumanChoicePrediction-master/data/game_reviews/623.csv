216,Hotel Astoria Gent,"Although the hotel is next to the train track, we could hardly hear the train. Good soundproofing. We were surprised that they provided 5 complimentary bottles of drinks every day. - Coke, lemonade, beers and 2 water. :) Friendly and helpful staff Best of the 5 hotels I stayed in this trip !",WiFi connection was weak. Could only connect when I am nearer the corridor.,10
397,Hotel Astoria Gent,"Great location for the station. Lovely area to stroll around. Quiet location, noise from the trains nearby was inaudible if windows closed, but not if windows open. However, trains didn't run through the night, so no real problem. Helpful host offered advice for eating out and sight seeing.",It would be great to have a lounge area to sit for a coffee or drink apart from the breakfast room.,9.2

230,Hotel Astoria Gent,"All round very good. The room was well decorated, comfortable and spotlessly clean (the bathroom in particular was immaculate) and had a little kettle with tea and coffee. You don't get this in France, so we were especially pleased to see that you do in Gent! The hotel is well-situated for the Art Museum, and the city centre is a manageable half-hour walk away. Car parking is paying, but with lots of room for any size of car. Finally, the Northern European style breakfast was excellent, with a fantastic selection of cheese, sausage, different kinds of bread, viennoiseries, teas and so on. All in all, a delightful stay which ended too soon.",I can't see room for improvement.,10

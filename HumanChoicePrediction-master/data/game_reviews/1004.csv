12863,The Helmet Hotel,The location was good,"First of all the cleaning of the rooms were bad, broken bathroom door and paint falling off, there was no milk or creamer kept in the room when next morning I went to ask at reception they had just 4 creamers in the entire property which means only 4 people out of 13 people which we booked had coffee..
The beds were joint when we booked a double bed. I am sure you dont want to slee in between the beds.
Also when asked for the room to be clean they said there is no staff and will do it tomorrow. I think i own a refund

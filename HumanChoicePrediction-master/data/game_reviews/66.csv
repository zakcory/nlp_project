25678,Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel,"The stafd vere nice and helpful, the bed was good, clean bathroom.","The booking.com photos show a beautiful new facility, while I was gratly dissapointed to see a dirty carpet flooring with ugly wall platering and a very small ""apartment"" with the bed immediately next to the kitchen sink and microwave, all at 595$ for the five night stay! I have never been more ""conned"" into a high priced stay, and we had to pay immediately, even before we saw the rooms. To change your towels you had to add 2.5$ like this was not enough. And the location was not in the center or the EU district but three metro stations either way. Very dissapointed, would never recommend this as opposed to many other beautiful places in Brussels for the same price!",5

25311,Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel,I especially liked the staff! I would say they were the highlight of the stay.,"I think it may be a little overpriced. 10$ for the breakfast provided was a bit steep. For a two star hotel, 130$ is a bit overpriced. But I understand Belgium is an expensive place so I understand. I would still stay there if I got to come back.",9.2

5925,Hostel Bruegel,"My stay was great.  Although the hostel is centrally located, it was really quiet and cozy there.  The staff is very helpful and friendly, the breakfast was ok. The only thing is, we have got the upper floor room, so it was a bit hot in the daytime.",,9
6408,Hostel Bruegel,"Its location is not bad. The breakfast offered it's quite complete (bread, fruit, juice, tea, coffee, chocolate, butter, philadelphia, eggs, jam). Staff is nice, we asked for a hair dryer and they kindly lend us one. We were able to leave the luggage in the luggage room free of charge after leaving the room.","The shower didn't last for too long and you had to be pushing the button every 30 seconds. That was a bit annoying.  At the end of our stay we had to leave the blankets in reception, so a bag to take them all there would have been appreciated.",7.1
6420,Hostel Bruegel,"I had to travel to Brussels to do interviews for my thesis and stayed at this hostel all three times. The location is great, I could walk to all of my appointments at the EP and Commission. The rooms are clean and otherwise quite okay. Desk in the room was perfect so I could work a bit. Not loud, but I might just have been lucky with my roommates all three times. Free breakfast is basic but perfectly OK. Safe to walk outside at night, easy to find and easy to find places to eat around here. Good locker to keep your stuff in.","Staff was not overly friendly, and well, it's pretty basic. You get what you pay for.",7.9

There are different restaurants around for everyone. The room and bathrooms are clean.,The breakfast was not as I expected. It was small with few things. It is the only one negative thing I could find during my journey.,10

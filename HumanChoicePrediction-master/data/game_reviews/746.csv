10705,Hotel Imperial,Very comfortable bed (executive room)  nice bathroom. Brilliant location. Pretty breakfast room. Very clean hotel.,"If I had paid full price for the room I would have been disappointed. For a luxury room it's very small. The bed very low yet it was surprisingly comfortable. Tea and coffee was in the room a bottle of water would have been a nice addition.  Reception staff a little unfriendly and not very welcoming. Breakfast is budget standard. Canned fruit salad, fresh fruit bowl but fruit not so fresh looking. No coffee machine but big thermos coffee flasks mini canned sausages. It filled a hole but was nothing to talk about.",7.1
10763,Hotel Imperial,The breakfast starts on time and the food was good.,I didnt see any space for smoking. Thats not fair for people who smoke.,7.9
10715,Hotel Imperial,"The breakfast was included but due to an early appointment I did not take it. The breakfast room looked nice, conveniently located and nicely furbished.","The room was small and a bit outdated, but that is expected for this location. There was no minibar and no water in the room. There was no airconditioning. There was a LOT of noise during the night. From other visitors in the hall and in their rooms. I could hear whole conversations and their wake up call.",7.5
10545,Hotel Imperial,The location is perfect and we had view on the sea.,The rooms look old and especially the bathroom. Since we couldnt have breakfast etc they could at least offer a bottle of water or so.,6
10680,Hotel Imperial,The Location,The Bar was miserable during my stay I was the only person who used it!,8.3
10693,Hotel Imperial,Excellent location. Friendly staff,"Bathroom with bathtub, shower hard to use without getting a lumbago. The 'very small ' and particular bathtub with its non convential shape was completely clugged up.  The sliding door to the bathroom was tranparent. Not a room for elderly and would be convenient as a single room. Pictures on your site gave an impression of a much larger room . . .",6.7
10602,Hotel Imperial,"Overall clean, good breakfast. Good value for money but not amazing.","The lift was broken the first day, not great when you have health issue.  Also altough it's not the hotel's fault the guests were noisy and you could hear a lot of noise when you were in your bedroom.",5.8

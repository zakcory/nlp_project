2017,Hostel Blauwput Leuven,"perfect location next to the main trainstation. Staff is friendly and helpful. Got a bigger room than booked and had a good sleep. Everything is basic, as to be expected at a hostel, but well organised, clean and quiet.",all good.,9
2010,Hostel Blauwput Leuven,"Breakfast was great, the location is fantastic when coming with the train and you can walk into the centre pretty quickly. Extremely nice staff, very helpful! The rooms could be a bit more ""cozy"", concerning the decoration etc. But that is just an extra, after all it is a hostel so a clean sleeping place is great! Also good thing was, that the bathroom and shower were separate but still in the room, so no weird through the hallway walking for a shower. Very nice!","The matresses were indeed a bit hard, but I don't think it's a big deal since this is a hostel which was great, good price in comparison to others and it was very clean. A bit more ""decoration"" could be nice, as the rooms were a bit cold, but that is just a very small thing.",8

2225,Hostel Blauwput Leuven,"Close to the train station, decent beds",There is no kitchen or microwave you could use. Which is a bit shame for a hostel. And WiFi was only in common areas and not in the rooms,7.5
2039,Hostel Blauwput Leuven,The staff does all to please there gasts. There is enough choice for the breakfast.  the rooms are big and it is nice that the toilet and shower is on the room and not in the corridor.,,8.8
2103,Hostel Blauwput Leuven,Decent hostel next to the train station with all the basic amenities you would expect from a hostel. Rooms have space and hangers to put your stuff. Same with bathroom. There are recycling bins. Kitchen seems to be lacking.,The check-in took quite long. I stood there about 15 minutes waiting for the two people in front of me and this is not the first time. I would really recommend some automatic/self check-in system. People should just get their keys upon arrival. There is nothing complicated in the hostel.,8.3

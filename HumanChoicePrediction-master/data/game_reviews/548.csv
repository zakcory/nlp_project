17036,"Holiday Inn Hasselt, an IHG Hotel","The employees were always helpful and could be contacted 24/7. Place of the hotel is also very handy, between both water and the busy shopping street. The parking lot was quite pricey, but on the other hand it was handy having direct access to it. Overall definitely a great visit and I can only recommend it. ","As a small critic point, maybe one or two drinks (even just water) could have been included in the mini bar, within the room. Also a discount on the parking lot if possible, for people that have visited the hotel. ",9

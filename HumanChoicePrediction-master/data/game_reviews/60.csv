Staff was very cheerful and courteous.","Construction near eating area was a negative factor- noise and dust.  When renovation is complete, the lobby/eating area will be spacious and pleasant - but not there yet. Carpeting in the apartment should be replaced. TV signal was missing, repairs did not fully restore system after 4 days.",7.1
25421,Aparthotel Adagio Access Bruxelles Europe Aparthotel,- The downstairs reception area was bright and cheerful.  - The staff were all helpful and polite.   - The location was relatively convenient: perhaps only 10 - 15 minutes to walk to the city centre.  But the Aparthotel Adagio Access is towards the EU quarter and gusts should be prepared for a degree of traffic noise.,"-It is a bit of a stretch to call this an ""Aparthotel"" simply by virtue of putting a small sink and a two-ring hob at the end of what was otherwise an entirely ordinary hotel room.  - The accommodation is very basic.  It was convenient for a few days; longer would have been difficult",6.7

9242,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,"The breakfast was outstanding, the best I have ever had in a hotel.  I contacted the hotel before my stay to ask please for a good room as it was a special occasion for me and my partner.  They offered us an update of the room if available (unfortunately it was not possible - of course as on August hotels tend to be full), but they have the kindness of giving us a box of chocolates a special gift. Very thoughtful.   We needed an iron and a board and also a couple of hard bags and they supplied to us straight away, we ask for info regarding transport and we were very well informed. When leaving the hotel they asked us if all went alright.","Seem to be a bit short of staff in some occasions, but anyway they responded well to all we needed.",7.9

8872,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,"It was near the Midi railway Station, very near the Channel Terminal. I had a spacious room.",The works outside the hotel make every journey from and to the hotel very annoying.  $21 per person for breakfast seems quite expensive.,7
8989,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,needed a central Brussels hotel and this fits the bill-walking distance from Gare du Midi. Street outside being dug up and in the rain was very muddy.,Roadworks outside made street muddy,8
9618,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,It was okay. They had tea and coffee and a kettle in the room and the shower was good. The bar area looked nice and the curtains were good at blocking out the light.,The location was near the train station but in a really grim area. There was a lot of construction work going on outside and you had to walk across a makeshift bridge/metal plank to get into the hotel. Whole area was run down and not pleasant to walk through.,5
9604,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,"Nothing to like, I find this hotel really disappointing.","The first room they gave ne has drainage problem, after I told the reception they changed me another room, but this room's floor lamp is broken, they promised they will call the technician to fix it, but in the following 5 days, the lamp still satys broken.. The bathro's is old and dirty, so is the rug, also the construction outside is very dirty. It's not close to the station, also the area looks not really goodÔºövery dirty and ghettoish",2.9

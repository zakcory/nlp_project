7494,Golden Tree Hotel,The bed was very comfortable and the location was convenient. The person checking me out was very friendly and pleasant.,"I was meeting family for a surprise for my father. My parents arrived first and the person on the check-in desk completely gave away the surprise and when I arrived told me my parents were already there. Absolutely no regard for guest privacy.  There was mould and chipped paint on most of the windows in the room and bathroom.  I was looking under the bed on checking out in case anything had rolled under and found rubbish belonging, I assume, to a previous guest.",6.7

6661,Golden Tree Hotel,Amazing personnel in the reception desk and the location is very good (walking distance from any major tourist attraction). The breakfast is also very good!,There wasn't hot water running in the morning and unfortunately the points earned for having a his and hers sink in the bathroom were lost because they were both broken (one was leaking on the floor and the other was clogged).,9.6
6531,Golden Tree Hotel,"The location is excellent, quick walk to the historical center, beautiful building. The staff was very kind and polite and accommodated our requests. The room was clean. There's parking (additional cost) which is convenient. Staff asked if everything was ok, showed interested and overall professionalism. There's an ice and vending machine at reception too. ","It wasn't a huge deal for us, but my feedback would be that the shower needs improvement. It was stuck in one position so wasn't suitable for taller people, it leaked flooding the floor and the drain was really slow, so water accumulated up to your ankles (shower is in the bathtub). The staff was happy to give us extra floor mats to help with the leak, though, that was good. ",8.8
6522,Golden Tree Hotel,Very helpful staff that let us leave our bags when we arrived early and the day we left whilst we went shopping.

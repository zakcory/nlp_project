22378,B&B De Bornedrager,"The decor was utter luxury whilst also being homely & comfortable. The breakfast was so lovely that I - a non breakfast eater, even on holiday - stuffed my greedy little face! How could I not, when presented with such an array of goodies; a fruit bowl including pieces of kiwi & passionfruit, yoghurt & granola, scrambled eggs, toast, waffles, danish pasties, a cheeseboard, cold cuts of meat, little bars of chocolate, cereals, tea, fresh coffee, fruit juice and bread rolls. We were offered a glass of champagne but unfortunately I was too hungover to consider it.  I can not recommend this lovely hotel highly enough.",Nothing could have been better.,10

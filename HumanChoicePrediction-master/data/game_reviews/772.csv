11075,Hotel Le New Matinal,,"The room is small and old. The hotel doesn't have elevator. The staff changed me from one to another and moved all my stuff without telling me. I left for work and when I came back, I entered into my room and my things were not there. They told me they changed my room and moved all my stuff. This is unacceptable! And also I was still able to enter the old room, that had someone else already. I tried to complain, but no one there speaks another language if not French (which I can speak a little bit, but can't argue). So I sent an email when I left to tell them my disappointment and didn't even get a reply with an apology.",3

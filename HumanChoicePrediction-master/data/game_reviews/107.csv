5249,Aris Grand Place Hotel,"Breakfast was adequate and delicious, but for stays of more than one day it might become a bit limited.  Location was fabulous: Grand Palace right around the corner, the Museum of Fine Arts within easy walking distance, as are a few supermarkets and many chocolate shops. Staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke good English. They smoothly and safely kept our luggage for several hours after we checked out.","There were not enough open plugs in easy to access places in the room. Soap is the only complimentary toiletry. Lugging (pulling, rolling, carrying, etc.) our suitcases up the steady slope to the Brussels Central train station through milling crowds of tourists etc. was not easy. Not a fault of the hotel, but of the square cobblestones in the area.",9.2

6380,Aris Grand Place Hotel,"Location was ideal, right in the city centre couldn't ask for a better location! ","No tea or coffee kettle in the room, breakfast was charged unfairly and the shower was loose and couldn't stay still.",6.7
6880,Aris Grand Place Hotel,"This is my favourite place to stay in Brussels from now on! Its location is absolutely great (just behind the Grand Place), it has really comfortable and nice rooms (I guess it was refurbished pretty recently), breakfast is good and varied and staff is very kind. Compared to many places to stay in Brussels in this price range and with the same number of stars, I would definitely choose it.","I actually enjoyed everything, maybe one small sugestion is to introduce some juices or water for breakfast, they only have coffee and tea (or maybe I didn't see it).",10
4752,Aris Grand Place Hotel,"Location, Location and Location - Its fantastic. 2 min walk from the Grand Place. Mostly all attractions can be covered by foot. All within a radius of 10 mins. I was in room 505. Its called the kings room with a nice view. 
The staffs were extremely courteous!
I will definitely book again. Recommend!","If I have to tell the cons there is hardly any. I feel at this category a bit bigger room would have been nice and may be we were lame to not figure out but the water from the bathtub doesn't go out. Had to tell the reception but they took care of it.

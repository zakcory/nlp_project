7776,All In One,,"Highly recommended!! Vinciane was so generous to upgrade us to the apartment on top floor. Although there is no lift it is worth the stairs..spotless clean, kitchen with all ameneties and toiletries provided. We also found a free bottle of champagne and an aroma diffuser as a gift! So sweet! And Alison is the best! Very helpful always smiling and hard-working! Breakfast was nice although it could have some more variation such as eggs and fruits. Location was super..but not if you don't won't to spend money ;) as it is in the centre of a long street filled with shops. perfect for women :D walking distance to all atttactions",9

17569,Seb's Studio,They were very kind to wait for us despite our late arrival. Perfect studio to rest and fantastic that our doggies were allowed with no problem.,,8.3
17629,Seb's Studio,"Not much. The price was good, but standards should be better. The beds were comfortable, but one was a futon with little access to it.",Having to sit or kneel in the bath for a shower. The key did not come out of the lock in a usual way and this should have been indicated. There was a need for more more paint to have been used. The floor was in need of some better covering.  The crockery was not of an acceptable standard. I think it was the worst place my wife and i have ever stayed in.,4.6
17509,Seb's Studio,"Seb was very welcoming. He owns a lovely old farmhouse with quirky features. The room was a good size and there were facilities for cooking, coffee machine etc. We stayed one night with our two small dogs while travelling to Venice, Seb did not charge us any extra for the dogs. Due to the rain, he even kindly picked us up from the restaurant that we had walked to. ",There was nothing to dislike about Serbs studios.,8.8
17727,Seb's Studio,Convenient location with a car,"The old and worn out house, extremely hot, the ""bed""on the floor, impossible to take a proper shower as the roof inclination is just above your head, the fridge out of the room.",5.4
17709,Seb's Studio,"Seb was very responsive when I emailed him about my arrival time!  He had the room available for me early and made my logistics to arriving at Namur so much easier!  We had parking that was very convenient. Also Seb made me feel right at home, gave us dinner recommendations and even invited us to his daughters birthday event.  It was like we were at home!  Thank you!!!",,10
17699,Seb's Studio,"Clean, quiet and cozy room, birds singing in the morning. Within 30 min walk from the centre of the city. And of course an amazing host. When leaving, we accidentally took the keys with us and realised it too late (damn, so sorry for that..), and Sebastien took that situation with great understanding. Next time we won't forget the keys I promise :)",,10

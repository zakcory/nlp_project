13817,Dansaert Hotel,"Location is perfect for central Brussels, with 10 min walk from the Central station.","I got a room on the first floor, which was rather dark and looked out into a tiny brick yard with light coming from way up only. The room was clean and spacious but some details were not great, for example the plug did not fit the bath, there were some chips off the tiles. I didn't have breakfast as I thought it was a little expensive. The price was very high, but this was the same for all Brussels hotels that night owing to an international football match.",6.7

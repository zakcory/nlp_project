20526,B&B Belgica,"Great location, five minute walk to van eyck square. Facilities are immaculate. The hostess went out of her way to orientate us to Bruges and suggest an exploration route, even walking with us along to  a main Street. Superb breakfast. We would always stay here in future.","Streets are narrow in the old town. There is plenty of parking but one needs to drive with care to the parking under the building. But that's only on arrival, we would always choose this BnB.",10

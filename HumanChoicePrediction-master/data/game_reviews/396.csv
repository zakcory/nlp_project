9705,Condo Gardens Leuven,"We were in Leuven for Werchter Boutique festival and this was the perfect place to stay for the one day festival. It's 15 mins walk from the train station and 10 mins walk from the old town.  The split level apartment gives plenty of space for the stay, including a small kitchen area for self-catering. Condo Gardens Leuven was a great base for our trip.",Some of the fittings eg electrical plug sockets are loose and need replacing - but still work.  The apartment could do with updating in terms of interior decor and some of the furnishings.,8.3

9820,Condo Gardens Leuven,People in reception were nice.,"I expected the room to be more clean but specially regarding safety there are many things to improve. I had paid four nights there and I only spent one because first night someone tried to go into my room after midnight. The front door as well as the main door of the building were opened the whole night, so anyone from the street could easy come into the place. Many noises during the night coming from outside and other rooms, besides the annoying hum of the refrigerator. Furthermore, no refund was possible. I would not recommend it.",4.6

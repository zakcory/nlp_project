5764,Aris Grand Place Hotel,"Location, location, location! It's very central, just few steps from the Grand Palace. Great restaurants are everywhere. Despite the fact that it is right in the middle of everything, your sleep would not be disturbed by any noise. Bed is comfortable and breakfast is good.",I knew that check in is not until 3pm. Staff were great to allow me to leave my luggage as I arrived earlier than check-in time. I went around and came back at 3pm but was made t0 wait close to about 30 minutes before my room was ready. Had to follow-up about 3 times before I was actually given my room. It is frustrating especially if there is a huge time difference from where you are from and you really need to lie down for a bit of rest.,9.6

The tvs could be programmed to show the English speaking channels.",No complaints.,9.6

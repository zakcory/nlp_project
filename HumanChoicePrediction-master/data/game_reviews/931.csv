19344,nhow Brussels Bloom,,"I was booking a room at ~23:00 online from the road. In particular, I needed a parking. The selected Accor Hotel disposed of one. At 23:30 I get a call from the hotel saying I would get another room in another hotel in Brussels - to do some, please come to the initially booked hotel. It was already difficult to find the hotel I have booked due to endless construction areas and one-way-streets. The new hotel was in the pedestrian zone and did not dispose of a parking. It took me 25 min to get there (constructions, one-way-streets, walking ..). I spent another 30 min to bring my car to a public garage and was in bed at 01:00. The bad rating is due to the fact that a room was offered with a parking and and the end I did not get it as booked. The employees tried to do their best.",1

14574,B&B A Cote du Cinquantenaire,Everything was terrific! Laurent was a wonderful host and gave us great recommendations. He was available at all the right times and gave us his mobile # in case we needed anything during the day. The property was walkable to the metro and many of the places we chose to visit. The  room was very quiet at night and the bed was very comfortable.  We will definitely stay here during our next visit to Brussels!,,10

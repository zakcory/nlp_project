21583,Autrefois chez Lina,A great host thank you! He met us on the street at 10pm and helped bring our things to the apartment. The property was so clean - absolutely spotless! It was a lovely little haven to enjoy at the end of the day. It had a very nice atmosphere with the mezzanine and with sweet bird and cherry decorations. He even left us some beers in the fridge which was a lovely welcoming touch. The photos don't do it justice!,My partner had to sit in the bath to take a shower as he was too tall to stand in the bath to take a shower.,10

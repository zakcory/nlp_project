Steven's direct family link as well as the building's link, complete with photos and stories of the rebuilding of the cloth hall, the cathedral an Menon Gate  were a unique and much appreciated bonus. All their recommendations were excellent.  The B&B has been wonderfully upgraded and maintained. Breakfast was of course excellent.

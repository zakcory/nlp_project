The staff was very friendly. 
Love the idea of an ice cream shop and Korean grill  in the same building, if we ever come back we will certainly have dinner on location.","The breakfast was good, however nothing special for the price.",8
10936,Chambre d'hotes CAPRICE B&B WEPION,"Breakfast was very basic, but I think Covid has alot to do with this.",Nothing specific.  Little touches could be improved on.,8
11137,Chambre d'hotes CAPRICE B&B WEPION,"It's like a boutique hotel with few rooms. We had #4 with river view (la Meuse/the Maas). Room was like a small flat, much more than I expected for 69,-$. This house is mainly a restaurant, so don't expect standard hotel services like 24h-reception. Breakfast was plenty with standard products at 10,-$/pP. I liked the bread and the coffee and the Marmelade best. The restaurant is quite good, and there are some good Chinese close to this place. Consider you are in a suburb of Namur. The road is busy by day but quite by night. Make sure everybody of your group is able to climb stairs.",Less mosquitos please,10

11957,B&B Anna's,Great breakfast with freshly squeezed orange juice by non other than Anna herself!  Anna is very friendly and offered to buy  for us flowers that we wanted for our family friends in town.  Lots of chocolate goodies in bowls to pick from.  Location is great very close to city center and right next to a great historic church.,Very steep spiral staircase to floors 1 and 2.  Mitigated by Anna herself hauling our baggage up and down.  Paid street parking near the facility is a bit difficult to find.,9.6

11868,B&B Anna's,"The 2nd time at Anna's and it was wonderful. The room is spacious, the breakfast very lovely and the hospitality shown by Anne just wonderful. Anne got in contact prior the arrival day and send us recommendations for the parking. She greeted us and explained the B&B and the surroundings. The room is wonderful, we had the room with twin bed option, and the bathroom is huge. The breakfast is delicious, fresh cut fruits, a delicious selection of cheese and ham / sausage and different cereals. Anne offered fresh orange juice which was very refreshing. The location is perfect - a 5 minutes walking distance to the old town. Close to shops, restaurants and bars. Just the perfect getaway!",,10

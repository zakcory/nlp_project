14466,Guesthouse Mirabel,"Breakfast was very good, eggs anyway you want them, cereal, meats, fruit, yoghurts croissants etc. More than enough, and all was fresh. We had 2 rooms on the top floor, 65 stairs, but we knew that, and was very good exercise as they do not have a lift, we knew that also. Great rooms and large bathrooms with all mod cons. Could not have been better. The owner was very helpful, what a nice man. Central to the main town squares, easy to find and parking for me, with a Blue Badge was great. Loved our weekend. BRIAN",I didn't like that we only had 3 nights. I didn't like that we had to leave.,9.6

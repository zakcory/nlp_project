3536,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,It is in a fantastic location.  There is also a really reasonable priced car park nearby as well.,They are in the process of renovating the hotel and rooms.  Unfortunately we were in a room in need or renovation.  I booked a room with a canal view for my birthday and was disappointed with the price versus the quality of the room.  Our shower didn't work terribly well and when i tried to use the hotel hairdryer it caused a power cut!,7.1

6470,Hotel Monsieur Ernest,The breakfast was really good. The offer was good and the coffee was amazing. They also had good suggestions for people with allergies.,The fire alarm went off in the night and how the personnel responded to the fire alarm was not good. I worked in hotels myself and the actions taken from the moment that the fire alarm went off were not good and not safe if there turned out the be real fire.,6.3
5855,Hotel Monsieur Ernest,"The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas, they had made a lovely effort to make the hotel look seasonal and beautiful. The staff were also really friendly and helpful and gave us a map and some advice on where to get some drinks during our visit.","When we were staying there, there was a large party of women (possibly a hen party) staying at the same time, they were obnoxiously loud, the walls are quite thin, they were very loud when they came back in after their night out and no one in the hotel told them to be more respectful of other guests. They were also incredibly loud at breakfast time again.",8.8

Its small thing but says the thinking of the staff.

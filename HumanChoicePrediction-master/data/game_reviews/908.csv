When I have to pay at check-out, I discovered this situation and I was surprised that the hotel does not use an identification way for people using the restaurant for the breakfast. It was not a pleasant moment when I have to say to the reception that I can not pay for something I did not use. The reception should take in account my concern for this situation, as anyone can go in your name and try to get in your room asking for a key.",9.2

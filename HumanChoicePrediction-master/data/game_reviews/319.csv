539,Central Bruges B&B,"Everything. The hotel was beautiful. Modern, quirky. In a great location close to everything.  Breakfast was really lovely with such a nice personal touch. Katrien is very welcoming and Was so helpful with lots of recommendations.",My only recommendation would be to make the breakfast go on a bit later. Being up and out early is great but it's also nice to have a bit more of a lazy morning when you're away on your holidays.  check out would also be better if it was a little later.,10

1608,Steigenberger Wiltcher's,I love these room on the top floor facing the palace de la justice. Phenomenal view over the roofs of Brussels.  The Bar is very nice. The coffee machines were broken two days in a row.,Construction in front of the building is never ending. Bottons for elevator are worn.,8.3
2965,Steigenberger Wiltcher's,I enjoyed.,The breakfast restaurant always needs to close 10:30sharp! It should be difficult for guests even your stuff.,7.9
2461,Steigenberger Wiltcher's,"atmosphere in general, the small rooms are still comfortable enough","airco was broken: according to the receptionist it was because of the warm weather, but it wasn't, it was broken. one pair of the complimentary slippers were far too small; it's better when both guests could choose a pair that fits.",7
2534,Steigenberger Wiltcher's,Hotel location was good. Building had a lot of character. Rooms were clean and luxurious.,"Stayed in room 204. Thermostat was not functioning room was almost a sauna. Facilities and finishes are starting to look dated and the hotel must be on the brink of losing the fifth star. Cheap toiletries, breakfast was average at best. The hotel staff do not greet. Bar staff was very poor and unwelcoming - need a little bit of serving training to improve the finesse.",5
2516,Steigenberger Wiltcher's,Facility is nice and spa as well.,"We had a problem paying for our room, because the deposit is way too big. It was almost double the price of our room and it's impossible to pay with a vpay card. The manager had to be called and we lost more than 1 hour negociating.",7

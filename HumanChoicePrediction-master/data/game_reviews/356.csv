But this place perfectly met my needs, as I was having a get-together with friends in the neighborhood and did not want to drive back in the evening.",7
15461,Charmehotel Klokkenhof,The staff was very friendly and the bed quite comfortable.,The room was not like the ones in the pictures. It was clean but quite old and small. The bathroom door was not closing. I find the rate too expensive for this room. It should be half.,5.8

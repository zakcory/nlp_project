1581,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"They were thinking we are going to have lunch and dinner at the hotel because of the COVID so the put a table and two chairs in the room. Well done, but it could have been better if they put some tableware and forks. Great staff and rooms were cozy. ","The breakfast was a little messy and limited for me. We only had some breads and no fruit to choose. We were given a bag with all the necessary item, but we didn't have spoons and knives. It was okey in general, but could have been a better experience with the breakfast. The staff was super friendly. ",9

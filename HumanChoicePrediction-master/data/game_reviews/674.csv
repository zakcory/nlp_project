2115,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,Great location and friendly staff.,"Hot rooms, with no AC. Windows had no screenS so we couldn't leave them open without having a mosquito problem. Older facilities. Uncomfortable bed.  We switched rooms because the first room only had a bath tub and had no room for an adult to stand up.",7.9
2421,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"The bed was comfortable and warm. Tea and coffee making facilities were good. We had a room with a view over the canal, which was absolutely lovely. The young man at reception was friendly and helpful, and directed us very well around the one way system in this ancient town towards the underground car park. The hotel was very central. Loved the Greek street-food place across the street. This was certainly the best food we had during our two-night stay.","The rooms were actually quite basic: ours reminded me of one of the better youth hostels I have stayed in. The carpet was a little stained, and I had to wash cleaning product residue out of the bath before I could use it. I realise that building works are currently being undertaken, and front of house does look splendid.",7.9

3226,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,"Nothing but positive words for this stay. The hotel is perfectly situated in walking distance of  all attractions. We had two new rooms at the streetside, with excellent isolation. If you are by car the parking ""Pandreitje"" is again in walking distance and almost a bargain at 8. 5 per day.
I will definitely come back",,10
2764,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,The location was excellent. The view from the breakfast table. The bed was very comfortable.,"Everything was a little sparse. By the kettle there was only one small bottle of water between us, 2 teabags and 2 coffee sachets, no milk. Very limited space for clothes for 2 people, no information about Bruges in the room and even the pieces of soap were tiny. We'd paid extra for a standard room rather than a budget room and yet it was fairly small and I'd thought would have a river view rather than a noisy road view.",6
2129,Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,The bed was great .we had a budget room so no air con so very hot on hottest day of year. Breakfast was great staff good,Could not sit out side with out buying a drink I think was unfair,9.2

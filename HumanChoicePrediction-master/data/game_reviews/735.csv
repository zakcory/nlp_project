23051,Hotel Europe,"Nice staff, swimming pool nice when not too crowded","Beds are quite uncomfortable, as well as pillows",6
23265,Hotel Europe,Location,"Swimming pool is really small, they put bedrooms above the  swimming pool so if you start to laugh and speak the staff will come and tell you to be quiet. The mattresses are not that comfortable. The airco works really slow. The breakfast was not much more than cereal bread and yoghurt. Just basics. Not worth the 4 stars. The staff was polite tho!!",7.1
23068,Hotel Europe,"Lovely pool, very nice staff and food service in these corona times was excellent and very good food too! 5 min walk to the beach. ","Too much noise from the street and it started very early in the morning, a lot of traffic, including a film recording. Not great when you come for a relaxation holiday. Wifi a bit shaky.",8.3
23130,Hotel Europe,"Location is excellent.  In the city center and few steps from beach promenade, harbour and main  shopping area. Rooms are comfortable although a bit smaller but spacious enough for shorter stay. It was cleaned every day with daily challenge of towels and few times a week change of bad sheets and covers. Polite and helpful staff. Excellent offer of bread for breakfast and very good coffee. ",Wifi and internet access was very bad and almost impossible to connect. It is a pity for rather nice hotel in city center. Offer for breakfast could have been better.  There should be more variation and restaurant should have been bigger.,8

1586,Green Fields - Durbuy,"Amazing stay, couldn't have had a better view. The fireplace, the open bathroom, the complementary champagne bottle, the beds, everything was more we were expecting. Great breakfast service, we even could take something extra with us for the day. The local pizza place in Durbuy delivers to the camping, but make sure to order well in advance.",Make sure to switch on the heating when you arrive as the tent takes some time to heat up.,10
1553,Green Fields - Durbuy,"The scenery is amazing - public facilities looked neat, clean and new.","There were construction activities during our stay, we did not know about. It made quit some noise.  Even though the (Shaka) tent looks very nice, a couple of things were broken, like the toilet handle, bathroom light, piece of (outside) chair was missing, value for money was not to be found there. Also, we received the keys for a second row tent, while there were tents available on the first row, prices were the same, but still were given a tent with a much lesser view.   The second night of our stay, there was a party going on and even though they were asked (at midnight) to turn down the music and be considerate of others, this was ignored and sleeping was impossible until after 1.30AM.",6
1396,Green Fields - Durbuy,"The decor and place was amazing, such a beautiful location, very original concept and great for kids.
The food was also very good, the breakfast was very complete, so many activities around and all family friendly","We had an experimental tent because it was the only one left, and I think the price was very high because it was last minute but I feel like it was too high for the available facilities and service.
The showers were not clean or handy and the service was quite slow and bad.",8

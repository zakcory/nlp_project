18354,Jam Hotel,"Comparing to other hotels, the Jam was an average one. The room was OK, quite large and I particularly liked a large, ellegant bathroom. Breakfast was OK, too. In January, the tea set in the room was a great help.","For me, the design was too much. The photos in the hotel gallery look much better than reality. I do not mind an industrial style or admitted concrete at all but some grafiti on walls were truly scary. The ride by lift was an absolutely claustrofobic experience.",6.7
18636,Jam Hotel,,"We choose this hotel because it was rated really good. We assumed it will be really clean during corona, but it wasn't (look at the pictures). Also there is NO AIR CONDITION!!!! We had one little fan for the whole room. The room was also super small. The Pool was very crowded and nobody was wearing a mask at the pool side. The Rooftop Bar was also super full and there is no AC either. We are really sorry that we have to complain about that, but it was really just a disappointment..",3

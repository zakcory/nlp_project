6808,Flandria Hotel,"Reception was very friendly and offered some useful tips on the local area.  Breakfast was very nice.  WIFI was fast enough to watch TV via my laptop.  The hotel is located close enough to the centre of town to have easy access to restaurants and shops, but also located down a quiet road so that there is no noise from traffic.",Double-bed was actually 2 singles pushed together - which is a pet hate of mine.  En-suite bathroom needed some repair and smelled of damp.,8
7153,Flandria Hotel,Good central location. Good staff. Good breakfast,"Despite stating that parking was available..it isn't. We were shown the streets where free parking on a Sunday evening was but it was obvious that you couldn't park there. The streets were too narrow. Where we did park we received a parking ticket at 8pm on a Sunday evening. Talk about keen ! 
The hotel is more of a hostel than a hotel ",6.3

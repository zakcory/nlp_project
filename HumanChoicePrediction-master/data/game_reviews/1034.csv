Rather expensive. ",6

22302,TripInn Eden Antwerp,"For the price we payed the room was quite basic, we were expecting a higher standard. Everything quite simple, but clean and ok for one night. The area was nothing special but for us it was important to stay not far from the bus and train station and for this the location was perfect. The breakfast was ok and we could leave our luggage in the hotel after check-out.","Rooms very simple, not very comfortable but functional, lack of decoration or any additional details. The view from the room was not very nice, an ugly office building or something like this.",7.1
22316,TripInn Eden Antwerp,"Hotel was super cross to the train station and the main shopping street- however as he city is quite small it was pretty easy to walk anywhere.  The rooms are basic, similar to a travel lodge in the UK. Everything is clean and bed was comfy.",Room was a little small- we both had quite big bags and was difficult to manage when in the room!,7.5

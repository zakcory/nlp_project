1103,Flatcom Hostel,"Cozy hostel perfect for a short stay with fanatics staff, although we can't communicate in English(like most Russian City) their attitude is really good and very helpful! ","Atmosphere wasn't like hostel, but it's alright :)) ",9.2
1244,Flatcom Hostel,,"Staff unpolite. Guy at check in, did not even say hi. Not the place to stay in if you really want to rest. Loud in corridors and people listening music with speakers with no stress. Only 2 bathrooms for so many beds.",3.8

1221,Flatcom Hostel,..,"Registration is not made. We paid a fine of $ 103 for this reason. Disrespectful staff, dirty rooms, noise. Very far from the center. A bad hostel . (",1
1152,Flatcom Hostel,It was clean enough. The beds are pretty comfy. Not too far away from the subway station (about 10 minutes by foot). A supermarket in the next building (8am-11pm). The stuff was friendly and helpful.,"Super thin walls, you can hear every word if people in the next room are talking in normal voices. No common place to sit and relax. There is only a tiny kitchen with bar stools or you can sit on your bed, there's no other option. From what I've understood there are rarely any travellers among people who stay there - but just people of different age who come to work. This gives the hostel a different vibe from what I'm used to.",7.9

1146,Flatcom Hostel,"I do this evaluation considering the amount paid by the room, which was very low. The address was very easy to find, but when I arrived in the morning nobody answered the door.. I gave it some time and finally I managed to get in. The receptionist spoke very little English, but understood nicely Spanish, so we manage to understand each other. The bed was brand new and very comfortable, with your own lamp and power plug.","At first the room didn't look that nice, maybe because it is a bit too crowded. At the end, it was good - it was just a bad first impression. Overall an ok hostel.",7.5

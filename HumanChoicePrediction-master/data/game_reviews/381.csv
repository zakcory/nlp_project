4063,CityHome Antwerp,"Excellent location, clean and brand-new renovated flat with all facilities needed it. Very cozy, clean, decorated with taste, fully equipped apartment. Perfect location, two minutes from the cathedral. Easy to get there. For the collection of keys, we phoned the owner who opened us the main door remotely.",Smart lighting system drove us crazy during the weekend. The lights were turned on and off at midnight while we slept even if we turned it off. This system is not necessary for a small apartment like this.,8.3
3940,CityHome Antwerp,"Great location, close to supermarket, restaurants, metro, taxis.  Very central.
Apartment had all we required - kitchen with plenty of utensils, clean bed linen, small bathroom but good shower 
Owner was very helpful - I left jewellery behind in error when checking out.  I phoned him.  He went to apartment, found it, called me back and volunteered to travel to where I was to give back me to.  Service above and beyond...","The climb to the upper sleeping area is a challenge - Not for those who may need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.. And when you get up there, the ceiling is quite low.   Children over 8 or 9 and teenagers would certainly enjoy it, but not for unfit or elderly!...",7.5

4078,CityHome Antwerp,"Position, Kitchen Equipment,",This is more a suggestion: even if it wasn't a problem for us it would be better to make clear that the second double bad is not easily accessible,8.8

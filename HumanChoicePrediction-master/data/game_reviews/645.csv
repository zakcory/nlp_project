7559,Hotel Bon Accueil,"The friendliness of the staff and proprietors. The handsome beauty of De Haan and the ambiance of the hotel building, the cleanliness, the car parking, the garden, the honesty bar and many other things contributing towards a very pleasant stay. Also it's not far from the E40, for trips to Bruges, Ghent and beyond.",Perhaps only the stairs to the top floor but little else! I would blame the current Euro exchange rate for not giving it a top value rating!,9.6
7544,Hotel Bon Accueil,Excellent continental breakfast. Other facilities are on a honesty box basis. Good parking and the set up means you have the room without being fussed over unless you require anything.,,9.6
7529,Hotel Bon Accueil,Excellent breakfast - a bonus was the little kitchen with free tea and coffee and a small kitchenette with microwave. Complementary home made cakes and biscuits  is a lovely touch. Also drinks in good fridge on an honesty basis is a very good idea.  I was able to rent a room electric cool box for 2 euros per day for my Cava!!,nothing,10

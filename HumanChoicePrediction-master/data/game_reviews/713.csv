25378,Hotel Du Congres,"Excellent location, friendly staff.",The room was the smallest and most basic hotel room I've ever stayed in but since I just needed somewhere to put my head down for the couple nights I was okay with it. If I had intended to spend any length of time in the room I think I would have found it too claustrophobic. I didn't get the impression from the website that it would be as small as it was.,7.9
25777,Hotel Du Congres,"I love the hotel design, location and staff. The bed was comfy, quiet, suitable for a short business stay. ",A minibar would be useful.,9.2
26147,Hotel Du Congres,Small and basic but very clean. In a nice location for some bars and restaurants,The walls were very thin and when I woke in the night I couldn't get back to sleep as the person next door was snoring very loudly!,6
25066,Hotel Du Congres,Good location; easy to find; near a Metro station with easy access to Brusells Midi; easy walking distance from Gare Centrale. A pleasant old building with quiet rooms.,"Breakfast rather unimaginative, but for an alternative there are many cafes within easy distance. Tea/coffee facilities in the rooms would be a welcome extra.",8
26057,Hotel Du Congres,"The location. But is is full of hotels nearby, I'll never get there anymore. The fact that I had to stay only one night.  They kept my luggage during the day (as every hotel do). The day manager was polite.","Room at the third floor of a dependance across the road; incredibly no lift; 6 flights like the one in the picture for 130 euros. . Not even a warning of it. Small room. Extremely small shower. Do to a problem of the mixer, unusable (only extremely hot water coming out). Get to get out and across the road in order to have breakfast.",1
25910,Hotel Du Congres,"Location is exellent, centre of the city. Five minutes of walking to Central Station. Taste of old part of city.  Staff is very frendly. Breckfast good. Optimal solution value for money.",,7.9
25545,Hotel Du Congres,"Great value for money for solo travellers. Neat modern rooms, 24 h reception, bed is comfortable. Maybe rooms lacking some spirit, but yet again this is a conference hotel. Tidy and functioning.",,8.8

20409,B&B Belgica,"We had a lovely stay here - the hosts were very welcoming and joined us for breakfast in the morning. They made something special to eat every day and gave good tips about the city. The room with the terrace was great, we could enjoy a break in the afternoon before heading out to the city again for dinner. It's in a peaceful and charming neighbourhood, not very central and it made for a pleasant walk by the canal back to the room in the evening.",,9.2

20539,B&B Belgica,"We loved this place.  In a trip that was over a month, this was our favorite place.  It's like staying with your favorite aunt and uncle who love to spoil you.  The room was lovely, bathroom the same, bed extremely comfortable, could have been in a very fine hotel.  Free parking under the house, very convenient, especially in Brugge.  But the best thing was the breakfasts, which were lavish, and never the same from one day to the next.  AND there was a dessert each day.  For breakfast.",Nothing,10

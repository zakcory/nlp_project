11715,Apart! & Moment!,"Good location, nice decorated apartment. Good breakfast but needed to ask since wasn't included in the price and the suggestion of the owner was to have it ""a la carte"", what will make it quite more expensive. ","Poor sound isolation. Reserved a duplex but got a loft (open spaces). My daughter need to sleep in the living room but light went through since windows don't have curtains!! Stayed 5 days and the apartment wasn't clean, not even once! No complete toylet. There's no lavatory on the ground floor. ",5.4

11679,Apart! & Moment!,"The location of the apartment was central and right next to the beach.
A spacious apartment with plenty of room for 4 people.
Nice view, design and clean flat.","The pillows were really bad and uncomfortable, and sadly so, the beds as well. Little to hard for our preference.
Checking in was a little unusual. the reception was closed so you had to call a number after 4 o clock, so basically you checked yourself in. And no staff around for 2 days.
Not much for customer service. ",7.9

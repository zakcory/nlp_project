3280,Hotel Boterhuis,"Iloved this place.  The staff are super nice, the location is great, the building is beautiful and the breakfast is really delicious.  The room is huge and comfortable.","Not sure if this is a local thing, but the building is very poorly lit in the corridors and stairs.  The stairs are spiral and no lifts so at night it is a bit hazardous going up to our room with luggage.",9.6
4040,Hotel Boterhuis,Breakfast area and food was amazing.   Nice little private patio.  Room was good size and had everything needed.  Modern bathroom.,"Had to get housekeeping to clean up cobwebs on ceiling.   At check-out, the computer did not work so we had t wait while the lady figured out what to do, but we were in a rush to catch a train.   A little nerve racking.  Not enough counter space in the bathroom.",7.5
4024,Hotel Boterhuis,Excellent breakfast.   Old historic building with ambience.,"The loo was a bit uncomfortable, very high off the floor! The duvets were too thick for us, but sleeping without them was too cold.   A sheet and blanket as an alternative would have been good, although we didn't actually ask if this could be provided.",8.3

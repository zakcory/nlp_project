17471,Hotel Aazaert by WP Hotels,Functional - ideal for what we were after. Breakfast was amazing and worth a special mention.,"Wi-fi connectivity in the room was poor. 
One member of staff at reception far less friendly from all the others which were great",8.8
17564,Hotel Aazaert by WP Hotels,great location: exactly between the Blankenberge Beach and the train station; a small but neatly arranged room; good quality and varied breakfast buffet,I could not understand why they did not have enough keys for the garage - we had to return ours every time we used it.,8

17360,Hotel Aazaert by WP Hotels,"The hotel is in a fantastic area, almost on the beach. The pool area and pool itself was great, also well adjusted to covid restrictions. Rooms were clean. Breakfast was delivered to the room and it was really abundant. However, the biggest treasure of our stay was Mo, the guest manager. Smile, helpfulness, patience explaining things - he has it all. ""Mo is the best"" said my 9 yrs old daughter and asked me to come back to this hotel. We definetely will.",,9
17408,Hotel Aazaert by WP Hotels,"Excellent location really easy to find. The Hotel staff was wonderful very helpful and concerned with the best way to please us. Swimming pool was open we were able to enjoy it but unfortunately the SPA closed due the actual COVID situation. Breakfast follow the same principle, the staff was always on top of us nothing missed. Was not a buffet again due the restrictions, but all we asked for was provided accordingly. We were impressed with the care of all.","Only remark will be with regards to the parking, that limits the distance and time me as tourist can park and walk to the hotel. The big car park is 10m walking to the hotel, with luggage and rain is not very pleaseant",9
17594,Hotel Aazaert by WP Hotels,"We booked a weekend away to the coast in Belgium an found this hotel in Blankenberg by coincidence.
The reviews of this hotel caught my attention aswell the value for money. We did not hesitate to make a reservation, and we absolutely do not regret it. It was the perfect choice.
The hotel itself including the facilities, the rooms and the staff are outstanding and they do their job really professional and always welcoming for any questions you have. Always a smile on their face, they made us feel so welcoming.
My wife and I we can only recommend this property and we will definitely come back to it.
Moreover, the breakfast in the morning is an absolute beauty!! Outstanding and really attentive staff!! :)
Recommend by 2 happy weekenders from Luxembourg.

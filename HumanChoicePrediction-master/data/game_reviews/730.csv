3074,Hotel Eurocap,"The bathroom was very nice, shower was lovely plus it was clean. The kitchen in the room was very useful but we had no kettle. ",The bed was very comfortable but the room was very dated. My window was held together with cello tape and it rained heavily which came in through the window sill. I wouldn't recommend for price.,5
3235,Hotel Eurocap,Location is not bad. Parking availability. The room is big enough. Internet connection was good.,"The receptionist wouldn't let me pay in cash, eventhough I had the option paying in cash or use my credit card. I tried to explain but he remained stabborn and doesn't want to listen. Breakfast was almost non existent! Cold tea and coffee, no eggs, no ham, no meat product at all, no tea spoon. Shower sprinkler too short (ca. 1,70m), some bulbs were broken, the drain in the bathroom were blocked, both the sink and the shower drainage, no soap, no light in the underground parking, the stove didn't work, no utensiles in the kitchen cabinate .. I wonder how it's possible to award a hotel with two stars when all the above things and more are missing!",4.2
3397,Hotel Eurocap,,"The room was not ventilated for ages: smell of the room was awful! The bed was really very uncomfortable: 2 mattress each on other and moving to all sides, windows opening handle -broken. The furniture of bathroom was broken (MISSING DOORS), many rusts on the walls.  It is needed to take medicine control to take a look if You did not catch diseases from this hotel (nail fungus or etc)!!!!  It was really very POOR hotel and the price do not match such type of room. Shame on hotel staff, who can not speak english. I am strongly disapointed with this one booking.

25290,CityLoft Eilandje,"Spacious and a fantastic location - Overlooking the MAS and it was wonderfully warm and spacious with excellent 'open' wi-fi from the adjoining restaurant 'Napos', the key collection was easy and painless and I can recommend this Apartment for value location and space (2 Bedrooms * 2 shower rooms)","(Unfortunately the Oven/Grill didn't work and there was no toaster), This affected breakfast as there was no way to prepare toast (but this was not a big issue)",9.6

25156,CityLoft Eilandje,Easy self check in process and directions to very well priced car park $3.80 for 24hrs and only 10mins walk from the apartment. Very cool and trendy apartment that has been decorated to a high quality. Strange taste but nice to explore,"Some things had not been cleaned, eg. On top of things and behind things. Generally the floor and beds were clean but the place needs a deep clean.",8.3
25234,CityLoft Eilandje,It was amazing and the apartment was bigger than any apartment we ever stayed in. Only minus is noise.,It was a little bit louder at night time but that what u have to expect in an area like this.,10
25140,CityLoft Eilandje,Location is brilliant and great price for city centre. Apartment is huge compared to what you would get a hotel room for same price.,"The master switch takes some getting used to, we had to leave lights on downstairs during the night in order for others to work. Shower temperature is very unpredictable, one minute ok, next minute scalding hot then freezing. ",7.9

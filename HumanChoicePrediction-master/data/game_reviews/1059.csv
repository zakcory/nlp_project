9950,Vayamundo Oostende,,"The staying from 16.00 till 9.30 is not really 24 hours right ? As it has to be. The automats with sweets and water do take money BUT DONT give the bought products back.  In the room was no fulfilled mini bar, like . why?  There were no sleepers and robes, no glasses in the room  For this price - (it's really high price) we were not satisfied",4.6
9912,Vayamundo Oostende,the location,"We found some cloths from previous travelers on the mattress and under the blanket, and when complained that probably the sheets are not changed, they didn't care and just said we write it down to tell the house keepers to be more careful!!!!
The coffee line was too long, I waited for 45 minutes to get my breakfast coffee. I know it was because of corona, but it could be easily served by personnel table to table and not as a station with waiting line!!! ",4
9873,Vayamundo Oostende,"The rooms are nice and very spacious, the bathroom and the beds are good, there is ample space to organise clothes.  The hotel is located right in front of the beach and a tram stop, the Reception sells tram cards as tickets cannot be purchased onboard.","Besides the beach, there is absolutely nothing around the hotel, not one shop, not one restaurant.   If you do not drive, you must take the tramway to the City Centre to find them.  The hotel restaurants themselves are cafeterias, big rooms with no atmosphere.  The wifi is inconsistent, and one of our rooms had zero connectivity, either wifi or 3-4G.  Also, it would be nice to have an electric kettle in the rooms to boil water for tea or coffee.",7.1
9886,Vayamundo Oostende,Value for money reasonable.,"Welcome, help and assistance at reception.",6
9899,Vayamundo Oostende,The room was clean as expected. We had a small balcony at the side of the building but still with a view on the sea.  There were no carpets in the room (I don't like carpets in the room as they often contain a lot of dust).,"The room did have a refrigerator. It was one of those using the peltier effect for cooling. These usually don't provide a lot of noise, so that would have been great in this room. However, the refrigerator wasn't working. We were only staying for one night, so I didn't want to make a lot of fuss about it to have it fixed.  The staff at the ""brasserie"" lack a bit of motivation to make your visit with them worth your while.",6
9834,Vayamundo Oostende,"Great place for families, free baby bed, good location close to the beach.",,8
9860,Vayamundo Oostende,"The room bright, large and airy, even at the end of the complex partial seaviews ! Breakfast wonderful despite being very busy, staff cleared tables and immediately got us seated.",No ' do not disturb ' signs which meant several unwanted early knocks from the cleaning service.,9

22861,TripInn Eden Antwerp,"Hotel was overpriced for the standard and location at $159. Think that the owners saw the opportunity to rip people off with poor value because other hotels were at capacity. The area where it is located is not great, back streets near the train station.","proximity to station - 10 mins walk - Hampton Hotel is much nearer the station and quite possibly cheaper, it wasn't listed on Booking.com",4

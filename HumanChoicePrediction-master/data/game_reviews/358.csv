1238,Charmehotel Kruishof,Rooms were very nice and we had our own little semi-private deck adjacent to the main bedroom.  This is a very quiet area surrounded by farmland with a nice pathway that takes you towards the town and eventually the beaches (10-15min walk).  The grounds have a nice common area with both indoor and outdoor activities for the family.,"It was close to the beaches in a quiet area, and therefore the majority of activities (bicycle rentals, stores, restaurants..) required a bit more walking to get there.",10

1190,Charmehotel Kruishof,"The owner is nice and friendly. 
Rooms are very clean and spacious. 
There is enough entertainment for a rainy day: billiard and football tables.
The beach is within walking distance - 20 minutes away from the property. 
Simple and delicious breakfast is served every morning. 
The minibar is filled with chilled beverages. (2-3 euro per non-alcoholic drink and wine and cava cost a few euro more)","You can have a tea/coffee in the common area, but it is a bit pricey giving the fact you have to prepare it and then wash and clean the dishes and the kitchen. At this property it costs 2.30 Euro but for less than 3 euro, you can have one on a nice terrace along the beach. ",9

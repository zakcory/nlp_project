204,B&B Place Jourdan,"Super helpful owner, very clean, comfy bed and great location.","The only small thing is that is a 3rd floor with no lift, something common in these buildings.",10
139,B&B Place Jourdan,"Personable, helpful hosts, easy check-in, great breakfast, newer plumbing fixtures (modern and easy to use), cool decor, great selection of books on Brussels to browse, quiet street near the Cinquantenaire Park and EU area.",,9.6
163,B&B Place Jourdan,"It is perfectly located, near to European institutions. The owners are really nice, friendly and helpful. Breakfast is amazing, better than 5 stars hotels. The room in well equipped, new and clean and the bathroom has a lot of space, big shower. Definitively the best option in Brussels.",,10
127,B&B Place Jourdan,"My son said that the upstairs apartment  where we were put up  is like a ""den"" but in a good way. We really had our little place, with a kitchen, great sitting spaces, and even a selection of DVDs. The good thing about the location is that there are some great cafes, restaurants close by, as well as a Sunday market on Place Jourdan. (We chose the location for Autoworld in Parc Cinquantenaire.)","Although the Etterbeek neighborhood is great, this place is a wee bit too far from the metro stations if you need to get around by public transport. Plus, the host persuaded us not to have breakfast (saving 40$ althogether, though), while other guests could have it.",9.2

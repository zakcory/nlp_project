The house has all the equipments needed, next time we will bring more towels on our own.","I booked via booking.com because the centerparcs website always showed an error when I wanted to proceed to paying.   With my booking.com reservation number I wasn't able to use the center parcs app to make reservations for activities, I always had to book at reception. No big deal, but probable easy for the IT guys to fix.",8.8

At the reception you can buy fire starters made with petroleum (for barbecue use) which causes an awful smell in the air everywhere. Instead, start selling or using bio block fire starters without offensive odours.  Very stingy with toilet paper.",5

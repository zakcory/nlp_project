11556,Auberge du Val d'Aisne,"Beautiful property, full of charm. Such a pleasure to just sit outside on the terrasse or in the garden and gaze into the green. Very spacious room with a huge bed (couple co-sleeping with a two-years old very comfortably). Tasty breakfast and delicious dinners, albeit on the expensive side. Quiet location, easily accessible and just around the corner from the start of hiking trails. All in all, a wonderful stay and would go back! ",,9.2

There was a quiche as a snack, a starter, a main course, cheese and a dessert all together for $35 p.p. Breakfast an dinner were very good.  The people were very nice, they even helped us to find a place of interest that is open on a public holiday.",,10

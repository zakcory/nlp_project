24201,B&B Het Zummerheem,"Last visit, we were delayed and very late, but they stayed-up so that we could get-in, despite it being so late - no words of acrimony. Very accommodating. Drinks in the fridge available, on the honour system - it is so nice to be trusted! I'd wanted to stay overnight a couple of months ago, but they were full - not at all surprising! I look forward  to staying there again in future.","something like tomatoes, gherkins or cucumber to go with the breakfast would be nice - the meat and cheese, whilst nice, were ""dry"" to eat.",10

25021,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"Good location, close to station, about a 20 minute walk to Groenplaats. Loads of rooms so as we were a party of 16, we could all stay at the same place. It was pretty much as expected from other reviews, no frills, OK price. Not great, not awful. Good for a lads weekend away, not the kind of place you would take your partner for a romantic weekend! I loved the city of Antwerp, far better than anticipated, would definitely visit the city again.",,6.7

25614,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"Location is perfect which was the main reason of selection. Based on the price compared with other hotels in same location, you get what you paid for. Bed was very comfortable and toilet very clean which is an important factor for me.","Table was detached from wall, no mini fridge or at least a bottle of water which is 1 EU.  Room could not be more basic. Free internet yes but the basic package so no speed, watching a movie on your laptop was out the question. My neighbor room had dogs, barking regular, surprised they let dogs in a hotel.",5
25666,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"Baaic hotel matching the price, don't expect luxury for $50 per night. Clean, good bed, room was warm, great location.","A bit dirty under the bed but nothing awful, just some dust.",9
25424,Century Hotel Antwerpen Centrum,"In front of central station. I was surprised to the price for the good room even if Sunday night in winter. Check in time is from 15:00, but the reception kindly accepted me at 14:20.",Nothing.,9

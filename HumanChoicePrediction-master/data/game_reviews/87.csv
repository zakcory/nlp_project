7403,Apartment Jules & Jim,"Perfect location in the city center,  apartment fully equipped. Couldn't have found a nicer apartment. Very cozy and the hosts very flexible about special requests.",,10
7657,Apartment Jules & Jim,,Front door lock to the apartment you could not lock from the outside (faulty electronic lock) and the back French doors to the back courtyard could not be locked and one door had a broken hinge which meant that the apartment was totally insecure whilst I was out. Fix those two issues and it's a great place to stay.,9.6
7617,Apartment Jules & Jim,"Perfect location in city centre, marvelous terrace (apartment's own terrace plus joint sun terrace for all 3 apartments), shops and restaurants within walking distance, The inhouse decoration  has a special character (retro), and personal decoration items are present (e.g. retro objects, books). River views.","Check-in times very limited (16-17 h).  I had to renounce to a boat trip to Dinant because I would have arrived only at 19:00 then. When I arrived I was told on Sunday that the front door lock had been broken the day before and could only be fixed on Monday, so everyone could walk into the house until then. But until I left on Wednesday it was not fixed.",8.3
7533,Apartment Jules & Jim,"Fantastic location right in the center of Dinant. Great appartment: roomy, clean, warm, nicely decorated, has all comfort including a dishwasher and a coffee machine.The owners were nice. There's a map with nearby hikes on the wall.",The bathroom smelled a bit upon our arrival and the shower needs some fixing but at least the water was warm. The bed takes some getting used to (it has a hard mattress).,8

7673,Apartment Jules & Jim,Excellent location.  Lots of room & outdoor terrace,"Little Things missing - tea towels, bath matt, shower wash. Broken corkscrew. WiFi available but no internet. ",7.9
7486,Apartment Jules & Jim,"Excellent location right in the heart of Dinant, next to the main attractions and restaurants.  Good wi-fi, nice kitchen and bathroom facilities, lovely back garden.  Although there was no parking available on the property, free street parking was available nearby.","It certainly wasn't the fault of the hosts that we were having a heat wave at the time.  But it was very difficult to sleep at night due to the temperature in the apartment.  There was no air conditioning, and no fans available.  We left the windows open, which didn't help much and also allowed in a lot of noise from the street.  We weren't expecting air conditioning but some fans would have helped.",8

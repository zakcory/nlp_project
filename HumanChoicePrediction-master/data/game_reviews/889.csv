22026,Le Chateau de Rendeux,"Old couple run the place, they are friendly.","Smell of smoke inside (in all rooms incl. entrance, hallways and restaurant). Dusty surfaces everywhere, unclean floors. Shabby and dirty bedlinen and furniture in rooms. All of this is not in line with the price for the stay.",4
21969,Le Chateau de Rendeux,The outside of the building is beautiful.,"Sadly, the inside is very simple and not at all in the style of the exterior.",7.5
21997,Le Chateau de Rendeux,"The bathroom is large and very clean, beautifully decorated  ( better than the room itself)
The breakfast is exceptional,  with home made  products and fresh croissants . 
The wines could be tasted from the own cellar in a cosy ambience.
","All was great, but I expected a nicely furnished room room . The TV set is very small.",8.3
21902,Le Chateau de Rendeux,"Nice room and enough for one person, the bed was comfy enough, taking into account that i am 1m90. The decor is not very modern but still clean and the bathroom has a nice size. The bathtub is good enough also. Overall for the short stay i had there it was really nice","The floors a bit thin in the sense that if there are people in the room above you, you can hear them a bit. The TV is really an old model, but again if you go there it is not to watch the tv :)",8
21894,Le Chateau de Rendeux,"Great location, most beautiful scenery, the gardens are lovely. La maitresse-de-hotel friendly and accommodating - we found really great options to dine out at her recommendation.",It would have been nice to have vegetarian options at breakfast. Dining in temporarily not possible. The internet connection was somewhat unstable (one of the rooms completely outside range).,7

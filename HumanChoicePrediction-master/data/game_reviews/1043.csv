24021,Tulip Inn Antwerpen,"The property was extremely clean and in a good location. Parking was free, which was great ! 
But the bed wasn't very big and it wasn't very comfortable. My husband didn't sleep well. 
The room wasn't very big either. 
The staff at reception was extremely unfriendly. The cleaning lady was very nice and polite though ! But unfriendly staff at reception/check in kind of spoiled it.
Next time I will stay in an Ibis budget because it's much better value for money. ",See above,5

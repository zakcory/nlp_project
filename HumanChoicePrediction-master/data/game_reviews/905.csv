3136,Marivaux Hotel,"The location is great for visiting the center of Brussels as everything is at walking distance.
The isolation of the room It's very good and you cannot notice the traffic from the road or the noise from the street.","The breakfast was a bit disorganised, they were removing it 15min before the closing time for breakfast. They did not replenish the bread, hot water, etc. during the scheduled breakfast time. ",7.1

2766,Marivaux Hotel,,"The hotel has disappointed us. Once we entered our room, we noticed that the floor in the shower is full of water, because it was dripping from a few spots around lights (!) on the ceiling. We asked for another room, the hotel staff wasn't even surprised. We realised that it must be something common for them, because in the new room the ceiling also had old traces of water. Everything in the rooms, furniture, towels, looks old, there was no fridge. The breakfast was also disappointing: the choice was very poor, the quality of food is not perfect either. Probably a few years ago this hotel indeed deserved its 4 stars, but not anymore. Only its location makes the hotel attractive, but for the rest it requires significant changes.",6.7

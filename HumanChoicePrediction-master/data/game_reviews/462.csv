24648,ferme st martin,"Very nice owners ! 
They were very supportive. 
The room was nicely decorated. 
Lovely old farmhouse ","For 120 euro we would expect 
- tea and coffee for free in the room not just a kettle
- fresh towels. The towels really did smell bad so we used ours. 
- a decent bed and pillow: it was just very old and used too much. 
- more reasonable prices  of the little restaurant required. It is not worth it to eat there at the moment. 
- overall totally overpriced ",6

12857,B&B Martijn Dewulf Ghent,,A dryer as well as a washing machine would be of great assistance!,8.8
12908,B&B Martijn Dewulf Ghent,"Very well appointed studio flat, great quiet location, very comfortable. 
Excellent breakfast option.",,10
12818,B&B Martijn Dewulf Ghent,"Nice small and cozy flat, with all the facilities needed for a comfortable weekend out. The hosts were also nice and we had a pair of good Belgium beers as a welcoming gift. They also offered us parking space inside the house, however we were not traveling with a car :)","We liked the flat a lot, only the location could be closer to the downtown (but that was already expected by us). However, there is a bus stop nearby and you can always take a 25 min walk like we did to the city center.",8
12953,B&B Martijn Dewulf Ghent,Breakfast was brought to my room by the owners & was excellent. A beautiful apartment & lovely hosts. I only stayed one night but would have liked to have stayed longer to explore Gent & talk more with the hosts.,Nothing!,10
12920,B&B Martijn Dewulf Ghent,"Very pleasant hosts, quiet place. With garage and possibility to bring or rent bikes practical cycling distance from the city.",,10
12941,B&B Martijn Dewulf Ghent,"Stylish Belgium house. Fantastic home-like breakfast - even we have paid quite a lot for it, it was worthy to it.",I do not recommend for older people due to steep and narrow stairs to our apartment. No chance to get there any heavy luggage for them. But for us it was no problem. P.S. other apartments were probably different with more easier approach.,9.6

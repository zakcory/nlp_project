9316,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,Hostel was really clean and I really enjoyed the accommodation at all.  I also liked that the hostel is situated near metro station and the city centre as well..,,10
9357,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,Clean and friendly,"Our room overlooked the courtyard, meaning it was extremely noisy at night and in the morning. We were also the room next door to the dining room which meant yet again that it was extremely noisy and busy outside our room early in the morning. Other than that the room and hostel in general was clean and the staff were friendly. The location was slightly poor. A good 20 min walk into the centre which wasnt fun in the wind and rain. Metro is easy to use so probably the best way to get about. Loved brussels though. Would visit again ",5

8619,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,Hostel has a great little bar with lots of great local beers at a reasonable price. They offer a free walking tour which is a great way to see the study and the staff were great.,Found someone else's rights in the room. The beds were quite hard and the toilet was slightly blocked from whoever had used the room before. If you want to use a towel it will be an extra 3 euros so make sure you take your own.,7.1

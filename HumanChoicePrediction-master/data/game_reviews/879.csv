19169,Jam Hotel,"I stayed there two days, The electricity was out of service two times and they couldn't resolve the problem and  expect me be patient and nice to them.   They were not even willing to switch the room for us.   Finally, four of us even stayed the room smaller then the one we have.",,4.6
17379,Jam Hotel,"Excellent location in a vibrant neighbourhood. We loved the rooftop pool and bar. Room was rather small for 6 adults, but OK.",Unfortunately we had very noisy neighbours in the room next to us and the walls weren't soundproof enough.,7
17755,Jam Hotel,Great location,Brussels isn't well sign posted so if you're not regular travelers one may struggle to find the hotel. Other than that can't really complain.. You get what you pay for!,7.9
18111,Jam Hotel,Staff was helpful and polite.  Design style of hotel was fun.,"The room was a little to small for three people.  The beds were not cozy, they had a single flattened pillow and awful wool blankets draped over the top of the beds.  I'm allergic to wool and felt like I was going to get a rash just from removing the quilt.  The wool quilt felt heavy and dirty.  How does a wool quilt get washed?",6.7
17796,Jam Hotel,It is a cool hotel,"The front desk reception was very unfriendly at the check in. 
No any words of welcoming.
I didn't have the same ID with me as the one I used for the online pre check in. This was a big issue I almost left the hotel, so unbelievable unfriendly.
I am the owner of hotel in The Netherlands and I would immediately fire my employe with this kind of attitude. Send him to a course to learn him hospitality!",6.7

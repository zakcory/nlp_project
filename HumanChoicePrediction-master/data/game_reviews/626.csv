98,Hotel Astoria Gent,"Extremely well organised for covid with frozen meals in fridges, microwaves . Really impressive. Loved the jacuzzi bath too !","The breakfast was good of course but why everything in mini, 1x mini pain au chocolat, 1x mini bun. Would be good to have a normal sized portion for the prize of the breakfast.
Having the mini bar next to my pillow prevented me from falling asleep easily as it gets noisy when it starts up",9

237,Hotel Astoria Gent,"Recently refurbished rooms, done to a really high standard.  The staff were very friendly and talked us through how to get around Ghent, and offered bike rental at the hotel.  The breakfast options were tasty.","There was noisy refurbishment happening in several rooms, and the workers started at around 8am which felt a bit early given we were on holiday.  The breakfast options weren't that plentiful, we had to ask for more stuff several times.",9

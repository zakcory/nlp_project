9512,St Christopher's Inn Hostel at The Bauhaus,"Good location: in the old town. Though, you have to cross the town to get to the train station.The room is very spacious. Every bed has a lamp and sockets to charge the phone. There are big lockers and a couple if chairs. The bathroom was next to the room, which also has a washbasin. On the ground floor there is a very nice pub to meet people, basically lots of beers and alcohol, it also offers pizzas. There is a supermarket nearby. The staff is very friendly.","The room is on the first floor and its windows face the street. The sound from the pub below gets muffled into the room, so I would say that's not a big deal (at least not for me), but you might hear voices from people on the street leaving the pub.",7.9
9525,St Christopher's Inn Hostel at The Bauhaus,The staff was really nice and helpful. I've missed breakfast as it is only until 10 AM which in my opinion should be changed but the person at the reception recommended me a few good places where to have breakfast. The one I chose from the list was AMAZING!  24/7 reception was the main reason I booked this place. Location is not that good but not bad either. Bruges is a small town so everything is close.,The fact that the bathroom was far from the room as well as the fact that there is no soap or some handtowels in the bathroom. I had soap in my room but I really believe there should be basic soap for handwashing. I had a private room so I was expecting more.,7.1
9572,St Christopher's Inn Hostel at The Bauhaus,Bed was good enough to have a good and deep sleep. Quite and warm surrounding inside the room. Bath and toilet facility was wonderful and warm to through away cold weather. Staffs were nice and quickly answered to my questioins. Table in the restaurant was quite good for having meals.,It is little bit far from the train station. Check in time is little bit early in the morning at 10am.,9.2

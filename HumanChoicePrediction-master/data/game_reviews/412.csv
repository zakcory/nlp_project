13575,Dansaert Hotel,The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. Bathroom mirror lights are very good The best was the location close to the Christmas markets. Staff was very helpfull and friendly. We received free breakfasts due to a water outage late in the evening,Sound insulation could be better as the street noise (police sirens etc) woke us up several times. There is no elevator to the 6th floor Bathroom sink is rather low. No street parking in front of the hotel but several parking garages at walking distance,7

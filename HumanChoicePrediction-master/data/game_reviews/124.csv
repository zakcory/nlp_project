2345,Art de Sejour - B&B,We stayed at Art de Sejour hotel for two nights March 23rd and 24th 2019. The hotel is about 1.0 Km from the Brussels Central Station. We took a taxi and it cost us 10 Euros. Our host Mario was absolutely wonderful. He communicated with me over the email and made me feel comfortable that the B&B would be open (the last check in time as per reservation was 7:00 pm) even though we were arriving past 11:00 pm. His response time to my emails was less than 2 hours. Our room was nice with all the amenities. The hotel has an elevator. Mario serves breakfast to all guests the selection is quite adequate.  We were able to get to all the attractions by foot.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.,Not much to complain. Great place! Highly recommended. Check-in checkout personalized,10

2436,Art de Sejour - B&B,"This is an extension of our previous nights stay.  We had booked a total of three nights so this is the same review as our Friday night review..The reviews that we read before the trip were excellent and we found out why when we arrived.  The quality of the building, decor, food, accommodations, and owners was exceptional.  From the communications before the trip were friendly, detailed, and timely.  The interaction with the owners was extremely helpful at the beginning all the way to the end of our visit.  We wouldn't change anything about our time at Art de Sejour!  For us, staying at Art de Sejour was one of the best highlights of our visit in Brussels!",It was perfect.,10
2630,Art de Sejour - B&B,We liked it all,"Mario and Ivan are exceptional hosts. They took great care of us during our 5-day stay in Brussels. When we arrived Ivan gave us maps and told us where to go based on our interests. Our bags arrived late and Mario received them for us and delivered them to our room. Every morning we had a wonderful breakfast with delicious food choices. Our spacious room was super comfortable with a great big bed, coffee machine, and food and drink items replenished everyday. We already miss Art de Sejour. ",10

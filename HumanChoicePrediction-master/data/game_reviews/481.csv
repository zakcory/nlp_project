6806,Golden Tree Hotel,"The hotel has an old charm 
The location was good for station and not too far to walk in to the main tourist areas 
Breakfast was ok (maybe a little freshen up of things would have helped) 
Apart from the member of staff at check in, everyone else was very nice. 
",Just the one member of staff who checked us in. My son is in a wheelchair and on check in she happily just pointed me in the direction of the stairs that go up to the lift. She failed to inform me that if I went a different way there is a ramp we could take to the lift. Very very unhelpful.,8.3

The location was perfect for walking to restaurants, the old town, and historic sites.","The drain in our shower was very slow which resulted in standing water.  When we requested help to fix it, the front desk said the would send someone to look at it but no one came.",8.8

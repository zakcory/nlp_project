1733,Apartment Aurora,"The apartment was excellent
The owners were welcoming and friendly and had even put milk and water in the fridge for us. The apartment had been finished to a high standard with en suite shower facilities etc in both bedrooms.There is satellite tv plus full kitchen facilities there was even a washing machine and dishwasher. The location is excellent, it was about a 2-4 minute walk from the cloth house.
The owners had even provided a filter coffee machine with coffee and filters. You honestly couldn't ask for more and I will certainly book there if I go back.
I would highly recommend the aurora apartments to anybody looking to visit Ypres.",Nothing the apartment was perfect,10

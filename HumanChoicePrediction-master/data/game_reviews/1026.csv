14335,Thon Hotel Brussels City Centre,The hotel is in a walking distance from the Brussel Noord railway station. My room had a bath tub which was great. I opted for no breakfast because I was limited in my budget (a business trip) so I cannot comment on this.,"I was slightly surprised that there were no free toiletries and no electric kettle (as promissed in the confirmation mail), and the room was probably smaller than the indicated 19 m2. Luckily I was the only guest in this double-bed room.",7.1
16035,Thon Hotel Brussels City Centre,Everything was decently clean in the room but hallways and reception could be improved.,"The room was tiny for the price, it was hard to navigate because the table was too close to the bed and it was in the way. Tea machine didn't work, it got stuck and didn't extract anything. WiFi was slow. For the price they charge, this shouldn't happen.",5
13959,Thon Hotel Brussels City Centre,Excellent location that close to a busy shopping street. High floor has good city view.,The sofa bed is really disappointed. Very thin mattress and super noisy bed frame that kept waking me up whole night!,8

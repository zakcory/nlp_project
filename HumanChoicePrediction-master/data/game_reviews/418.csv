14554,Dansaert Hotel,"The hotel is very nice.. located not far from the main square.. they are undergoing renovations in the main lobby etc. But the room it's self has everything you need, clean and comfy.. the position of the hotel makes you question what Brussels looks like but it's actually not as bad as you first think and it's beauty grows on you.. lots of little restaurants around the hotel.. if you've travelled by car there's a Q-Park just up the road from the hotel..",,9.6
13908,Dansaert Hotel,"The location of this hotel is brilliant - 5 mins walk from the Grand Place and a lot of popular tourist spots like Manekin-Pis, chocolate museum and famous bars. There is also a metro/tram station less than 5 minutes walk away where you can travel to some places a little further out. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the room was a nice size, modern and very clean.",The only bad thing about the hotel is that it's on a busy street with a lot of bars and is noisy throughout the night.,9.2

13317,Dansaert Hotel,"Room was excellent size. Lovely staff, they were amazing and so helpful. Fantastic location. Room was great value considering we went at xmas and the location. If I was going to Brussels again, I would stay here most likely.","We asked for two separate beds and they give us a double bed, even though we booked it far in advance. Lucky we are friends but not ideal. No fridge for our drinks. But overall, not much bad to say, was happy with my find.",9

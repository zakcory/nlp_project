17784,Guesthouse Vakantie Logies Hollywood,Property lovely but manager unnecessarily unaccommodating.,"Asked what time the bar closed as we planned to get back for anniversary drinks after our meal. 
Was told 10, got there at about 9.30 and they wouldn't serve us just glass of Bailey's  each as they wanted to close early. Despite us politely explaining that we'd come back early to meet the timings they told us, that there were 4 people in the bar with full drinks, that it was a special occasion and we didn't plan to be long, he said no and just shrugged.
Really disappointing as the hotel room was very nice and the small bar looked lovely - if only we could have enjoyed it. ",7.5

17851,Guesthouse Vakantie Logies Hollywood,"Our room (Marilyn Munroe Room) was at the front of the property, over looking the t'Zand and had lovely high ceilings and large windows, lovey and airy and beautifully decorated.  Property was very close to the t'Zand underground parking in Bruges and central for all of the old city. Continental breakfast was served in the comfort of our room, which was great. Staff very warm and welcoming.",,8
17864,Guesthouse Vakantie Logies Hollywood,"A room on the second floor with a view on tiled roofs, the tower of the Basilica. The staff is always ready to help and answer questions. Seating area in the room is very cozy (comfortable armchairs, tea corner) and gives you great chance to discuss your day drinking a cup of tea. The breakfast distinctive served in the room was very atmospheric and tasty. It is a GREAT ADVANTAGE of the hotel (still I have great desire to repeat it).","No reception, unusual entrance through the restaurant or back door, steep stairs. These small inconveniences are acceptable but you should know about them in advance.",10

10641,Hotel Imperial,"Perfect location in city center, very close to the beach. Room was small but functional. Enough storage space for clothes. Bathroom was clean. Breakfast was OK.","I do not understand why they did not put in a shower instead of a bath in the mini-sized bathroom. It was the smallest bathroom I ever had in a hotel room. A shower curtain would also be a solution. We heard the elevator the whole time because our room on the top floor (room 77) was next to the elevator. The food (ham, cheese, salami, etc) was not in a cooled counter at breakfast.",7.1

10499,Hotel Imperial,"Location fantastic - 100 metres from beach and bar district.  Got a very good price in early July.  Single rooms at the back small and a bit dark but perfectly OK for the price, and cleaned as soon as we went out.   All-night shop right next door.  Tram stop just around corner.  A little old-fashioned but we like that.  Luggage room for leaving your bags before check-in or after check-out.",No tea/coffee making facilities in room. Breakfast downstairs is expensive. Shower could do with an upgrade.,7
10575,Hotel Imperial,Good location. Old style plushness.,Unfriendly staff. Room dark and musty. Probably due to the Bordeaux walls that turned the small room rather claustrophobic.,6.3

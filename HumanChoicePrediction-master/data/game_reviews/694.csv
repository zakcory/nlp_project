22782,Hotel Continental Gare du Midi,"It is very close to Gare Midi and there were pedestrian crossings handy for crossing the busy road. There were restaurants nearby too.  The shower was roomy and good.  TV reception was good, as was WiFi.  We had a balcony which is nice, though the view was of the railway.  The beds were comfy and it was pleasant to have a real double bed not two singles pushed together with a gap in the middle.  There was a lift which was helpful as we were on the fourth floor.  Bedlinen was clean.",The outside wall seemed completely inadequate to cut out any traffic noise from the road and specially from the railway. There seemed to be trains all night.,6.7
22812,Hotel Continental Gare du Midi,"We picked this mainly because we needed to get a Eurostar train when we checked out. The location wouldn't suit everyone, right next to railway.
Friendly and helpful staff.
When we stayed there was a market just across the road that sold everything and was very large. I am not sure what days it is there (we were there on a Sunday) but we'll worth a visit. Old town was a fair walk away but that was our preference as we wanted a location near the station.","There was some noise outside. Soundproofing not the best.
Was a little overpriced for the location and facilities.",6.7

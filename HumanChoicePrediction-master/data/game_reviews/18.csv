463,Alfa Inn,"Sunday, my wife and I checked in in the Alfa inn hotel in Blankenberge. Is already our second stay there. Rooms weren't ready because we were early, immediately we got an upgrade to another very beautiful room. Wow!! What a room. Amazing. The lady at the front desk was very helpful and kind. The next surprise is the breakfast basket. I am a big eater, but we had to struggle to enjoy it all. Thank you, you have 3 stars, but this place surely deserves 5 stars. We will be back!!!!
To the staff of the Alfa inn hotel. Two thumbs up

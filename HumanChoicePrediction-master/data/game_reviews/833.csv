21514,Hotel Relais Godefroy,Amazing location right in the center of Bouillon. Property was clean and the staff was friendly.,A bit expensive for a small room with a shared bathroom (more like a hostel than a hotel) and the bed was very uncomfortable.,6.7
21396,Hotel Relais Godefroy,"The breakfast, the view on the river, the food around","The bedroom was so cheap. Matress was rubish.. The bathroom is very bad looking. the sheets were hitchy. You can hear the toilet of neighbors.. Im really sorry to give such a bad review, because the people there are really nice, but the hotel is absolutely not worthy 80$ a night.",4
21428,Hotel Relais Godefroy,,The bedsheet was not washed. Pillows had dirt and hair of other people. Room smelled bad. This is during Coronavirus times. I would never go this place again.,3

21347,Hotel Relais Godefroy,Welcoming staff at the desk were lovely. Family room was a lovely size and split so that it felt like you had your own section. Lovely view of the river and parking directly opposite the hotel.,"Staff at breakfast made us feel rushed even though we arrived 30 mins before breakfast was finished. We would recommend going earlier for breakfast as at that time there was limited selection as it was not being restocked. 
Light sleepers should be aware that the internal plumbing can be heard when the toilet is flushed/shower started. ",7.5
21523,Hotel Relais Godefroy,"Very close to downtown, quiet location. Parking was plentifull, Bbq restaurant was fine. Rooms were clean.","Very very basic room. Just a bed, tv, closet, and bathroom. And soaps. That was it. I've been in cheaper hotels with more complimentary items in the room such as tea or coffee. Lots of signs with rules and warnings. ",6.7

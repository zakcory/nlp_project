9924,Hotel Lodewijk Van Male,This was a great value for the money. It was considerably less expensive than staying in historic Bruges and had free parking. You definitely need a car to go to the historic center - but the cost of parking was nothing compared to the cost savings.  Breakfast was traditional continental and there is a lot of room to sit outside and enjoy (good for kids who need to burn off energy!),,9.6

The staff was not available at 18.00 for support on cutlery.,8

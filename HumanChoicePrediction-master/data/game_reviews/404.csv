They have also a nice SPA zone, however I did not use it. Excellent location in central Minsk - near to most important places and institutions. Comfortable big bed. Room was clean.","Some elements in the room, especially bathroom are calling for urgent renovation or at least repairs - especially leaking shower cable and leaking toilet. Some elements of the room, especially in bathroom seem to be very long used. Modest breakfast.",8

Comfortable bed.,There are smoking rooms in the hotel and the smoke was coming through the ventilation into my room and particularly into the bath room. Room was quite dark and without reasonable lights. Corridors are also dark. I did not like that security people have been sitting in the corridor during the day.,7.9

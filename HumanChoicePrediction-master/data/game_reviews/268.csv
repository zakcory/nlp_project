12109,B&B Salve,"Everything was fantastic! Claudine was such an amazing host. Very helpful and friendly. Besides, she is a wonderful cook. She made us feel at home. The room was super clean, bed, pillows and linen extra comfy. Shower with nice warm water. The wifi was very fast. There are lots of restaurants at a 10 min walking distance. The Neighborhood is nice and quiet, mostly family residences. Perfect for walking.  We are already planning our next stay with Claudine. Highly recommended!!  Thank you Claudine for everything, you definitely made our stay more pleasant. Big hugs from Mexico!",There was nothing to dislike.,10

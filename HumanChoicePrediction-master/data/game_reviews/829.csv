16355,Hotel Ramada Brussels Woluwe,Rooms were enormous. Widows very good and blocked street noise.  The gentleman host at breakfast was very good.,"All the rest of the staff were unbelievable rude or disinterested in the guests. Also, one night I went to have dinner in the restaurant and saw at least 6 couples/individuals seated. Not one had any food except bread rolls. I walked through the 2 rooms twice and still saw no staff - no where! So I left.  Receptionist doesn't even look at you or stand up when you ask a question at the desk! Shocking! Shower door stupidly positioned - no place to put soap or shampoo in shower.  No plugs near the bed.  Tv takes up almost the entire desk.  Some of the coach loads of tourists were very noisy in the halls.",5

26365,Glamping op het Zeugekot,"Will be good with kids. The farm setting is relaxing. The tent is well equipped apart from knifes to cut fruit and veg. The breakfast was good, just way to much. ",The shower. You were either burning or freezing. It never kept the temperature. There are no chairs for outside use although the setting is suppose to be outside. No umbrellas for the extreme sun. We left the tent open which was a mistake and the rain left water marks on the lounge set. It cost me the deposit. So remember even in extreme heat you need to close the tent (it was 37) this means it gets boiling inside the tent for fruit and veg. Therefore the tents are not really ideal in warm summer weather since it is facing west.,6.3

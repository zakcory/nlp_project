2159,CITYSTAY,"The property was very centrally located and easy to get to. The room was comfy, spacious and clean and we loved the modern furniture. We were on the ground floor with large light filled windows and surprisingly a quiet location of an evening. Communication with the host, Tobias was very smooth. Access to the property was easy through pin code. If in Antwerp again we would definitely choose to stay here again. I only apologise for our daughters tantrum on the last morning, but be mindful we had been travelling for several weeks before coming to Antwerp :-)",This is only a minor complaint but there was no mini fridge in the apartment.,10
2090,CITYSTAY,"Really nice interiors. Clean and comfortable room. Comfortable bed and nice bathroom. Located really close to the old town square! 
Tobias is an excellent and very discrete host. 
Ideal choice for a long weekend in Antwerp.","There was no actual wardrobe.. just a minimal hanger instead. 
Nevertheless it did serve the purpose.",8.8

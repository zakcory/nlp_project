16462,Hotel Malon,The room and en-suite bathroom were very clean and tidy. Breakfast was good.  There was a good choice and the waitress was very friendly and accommodating. Given that it was the hottest day of the year we pleased that we were allowed to eat outside.,We thought the picture of the square was of the hotel. It is not. Cheaper car parking is about 10 minutes walk and a pre-printed map would be useful.,8.8
16563,Hotel Malon,"Very cordial staff. Big rooms with all basic amenities. Nice breakfast. Our 2nd floor room had a great view of the square. Very close to the Rail, Bus stations and all tourist attractions are walking distance. Lots of eating and drinking options in close vicinity.","Stairs - narrow and steep. NO ELEVATOR! The October sun was soothing but the one in high summer can be harsh, with no air-conditioning.",8.3

18097,Hotel Koffieboontje,Breakfast was very good with a lot of bread and croissants and cheese and ham and fruit,Nothing,10
18601,Hotel Koffieboontje,I was a bit sceptical about both the hotel and the Brugge Xmas market! Unfortunately both had received several negative reviews on another site. Personally both hotel and market were great. Hotel was not 5 star and didn't purport to be. It was clean comfortable and in a great location. No hesitation in recommending. market was an Xmas market and delivered on that. Lots of shopping in surrounding streets. If you love beer and chocolate book today!,,9.2
16900,Hotel Koffieboontje,,The family room was pretty small and not worth the value.,7
18310,Hotel Koffieboontje,The Hotel is located just around the corner from the market square. Great to explore the city.,"Breakfast is served in the basement. The space ist poorly lightened, not very clean, dishes not tidy. The breakfast buffet has only small variety and no fresh fruit is offered. Very disappointing and not worth the money.",5.8

20118,Hotel 't Putje,"I really liked the location of the property. It's exactly where we wanted to be right near the buses and train station for daily trips out and also near to the square with shops and restaurants. I thought the rooms were incredibly nice for a 3 star and didn't expect as good as it actually was! The beds were comfy, the bathrooms were clean with hand wash, body and hair wash along with nice other additional things such as shower cap and shoe polish. There were a fair amount of plug sockets in the room which is always a handy and a fridge which I've never found  in other hotels of 3 stars - at least back at home. The staff were very friendly always greeted us when leaving and entering throughout our stay and the WiFi was really good too. ",,9.2

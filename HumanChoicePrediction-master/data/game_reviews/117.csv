5496,Aris Grand Place Hotel,,"We had an incident with one of the receptionists. He was a tall white guy. Even though his shift had ended and he was leaving, he made it his business to harass us while we were trying to get some hot water and a spoon for the tea that we brought outselves. Instead of trying to help, he made us feel most unwelcome, he treated us like we were about to rob the place. His remarks and attitude were very condescending. Thankfully the other receptionist was present while this happened and apologized on his behalf. He helped us get what we need. The other staff was great too.",7.9

Actually the location is also good when you like to walk 35 minutes to the Commission buildings - they are only 2,4 km away (you can also use public transportation, then it takes about 20 minutes).",The only issue was a street noise on the street as the room was at street level and therefore it was impossible to use the room without curtains because without curtains you could see people walking by your bed.,7

Location of the property is perfect for walking into town.  The breakfast choices were incredible, much more than in big hotel chains.  We have stayed in Ypres several times and will definitely book here again when we are next in the area.",,10
4641,B&B Ter Vesten,"Good location, easy to walk into the centre of town. On street parking (watch out for different zones where time is limited / charges) We had two double rooms, one had a small en-suite, the other had its own toilet and shower facilities just outside the room.  Tea / coffee making facilities on landing. Lovely  roof terrace and / or garden to sit out in. Breakfast was amazing!","Stairs are quite steep with narrow treads, not easy for people with mobility issues. Mattresses were soft, but that is down to personal preference.",9.2

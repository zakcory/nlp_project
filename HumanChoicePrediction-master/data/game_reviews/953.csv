16363,Parkhotel,"The staff (one guy who does it all) was very friendly, well informed and helpful 
Room was big and quiet ","The hotel has very dark/cold atmosphere,  not cozy at all. There is no reception (lobby), just a small desk on the side of the empty bar. The rooms are in separate buildings that we had to walk outside and many stairs. No lift, we had to carry bags, buggy and baby..
Make sure you book a parking space in advance, fills up fast, we had to park on the street and walk in the rain 5min
Was extremely hot inside, there is no way to regulate the temperature in the room, we kept the window open even tho outside was 2¬∞C
For all this, we paid 145$ per night.. wayyyy too expensive, shouldn't be more than 50$
Will not recommend it ",6.3

22896,Hotel Albergo,Staff at the reception was kind to us. Bathroom could be better. Amd the pillows are too much soft. but it worth the stay in this hotel.,,7.5
23059,Hotel Albergo,Almost nothing,"Very bad hotel, safety and hygiene are the least of their concerns and overall badly maintained - The closet fell down and i almost hit my head - The tap is broken - Dirts are everywhere on the wall, door, wc, etc .. - TV is not working (But it was the least concern ..) - You need to wait 15 minutes for the water to become warm - WC and shower are directly in the room, no real separation - Water leaks from the shower to the room - The neighborhood area around didn't seem safe See attached photos from inside, so you know what to expect I complained the first night about the closet and the tap but they didn't care much, I stayed 2 nights and i am really glad to leave this place. I absolutely don't recommend this hotel",3.3
22650,Hotel Albergo,"I really enjoyed breakfast. It surprised me. There were delicious croissants, cheese, ham, bread, boiled egg. Very tasty coffee and chocolate drink. The location is very convenient - close to sights and to main transport.","It was, what I was already expected from reviews of others - the hotel equipment and furniture are old (but room and bathroom was clean). Corridors and stairs could have been cleaner.",7.5
22983,Hotel Albergo,"Price, location, staff",There is room for improvement regarding the furniture and walls aspects.,8.8
22832,Hotel Albergo,"Very friendly and willing to help staff without asking for help. They helped to climb up the stairs my lagguage, as there is no elevator.",Must have renovation of rooms and furniture as  it without doors and out of order. The impression is depressing.,6.3
22872,Hotel Albergo,Ideal for a single/two night stay. The stuff are friendly and are speaking English fluently. They even offered me some complimentary water from the breakfast fountain.,The area is a bit dodgy. Went out to get some supplies from a corner shop. Apparently the place is close to `places` so dodgy characters are about. The corner shop bossman advised me not to walk around.,6.7
22674,Hotel Albergo,Hotel was clean. and staff was also friendly.,Hotel was ok but the bad thing was that no lift in the hotel and we stayed at third floor. with all luggage you have to go through stairs and no fan and ac and the weather was so hot.,6.7

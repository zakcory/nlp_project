1/ Location! City center and 1min away from the beach.

3/ breakfast
4/ service in general + respect of COVID rules. ","I could've used a bath tub. It was not the end of the world, but I'm used to it when traveling as well.",10
21906,Ambassador Hotel,"Extended breakfast buffet with cereals, wide variety of bread and toppings; clean room with complementary bottle of water; very good location near the sea side.","For the breakfast, there were eggs and bacon, but saucages would have been nice. There was a fruit salad, but in really top-rated hotels one would also find slices of water melon; the frequent tramway passing at the street is an advantage for the location, but a disadvantage for the noise.",8

21878,Ambassador Hotel,Breakfast was fantastic as was the dinner menus that were offered during the weekend. There was a parking possibility available and I also could put my bikes in the garage of the hotel (possibility to charge your e-bike if needed)!,"The only ""little"" thing is the tramline, it is just beside the hotel. The noise is not bad and it stops quite early in the evening and doesn't start really early in the morning. But you can hear it pass by, but bot much. So all in all, it didn't bother me, but I did notice it. But on the other hand, it is easy to get around, when you your tram pass by the hotel :)",9
22043,Ambassador Hotel,"Lovely family-run hotel, with beautiful rooms and excellent facilities. Great location, near the beach but right by the nice Dumont neighbourhood. Great breakfast and option of snacks/dinner for a bit extra.",,10

8367,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,The room itself was outstanding. Really stunning. Two floors with a private bathroom and sitting area.,Electricity kept tripping in the room meaning had to charge phones in the morning and wasting a lot of time hanging around. Also in the self catered kitchen facilities were poor and limited. I'm sad to leave bad feedback because the room it's self was stunning,8

8037,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"The entire hostel had a good atmosphere to it and there's a lot of activities to do (such as air hockey tables). The location was also convenient as there's a metro just 5 minutes away, but it was also around a 20 minute walk to the city center anyway. There was a separate shower and toilet for the room I booked, so I could easily maintain the cleanliness. Breakfast was included in the payment and it generally had more choices than other breakfasts I've had in hostels. They also allow to store luggage after check out so you can still roam around before you leave the city. ","The toilet generally smelled really funky, so it was good that the toilet and shower were separate. ",9
9213,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,The girl in the reception was nice and give us information.  The hotel was clean and tide. Breakfast was really good and you can choose a lot of good drinks and things to eat.,"We came back on Sunday 20.30hs and there was no one at the reception. The elevator was out of service so we have to go up till the 3er floor with our luggage by the stairs. To have to make your own bed.  It doesn't include towels (only one for the hands), nor soap for hands.  The tap of the sink gave me electricity when I touch it.",5

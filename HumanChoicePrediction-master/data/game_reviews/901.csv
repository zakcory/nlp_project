282,Marivaux Hotel,"It was easy to get to when coming from the main eurostar station.
The room was spacious.
Fresh bread at breakfast was delicious.","Our room was nice but felt like it was an after though during construction. We were located past the fire exit stays and near the staff lift. This meant most mornings we had to squeeze past the maids trolley. We had to move the trolley on check out to make room for our luggage.
We found tiny worms/ maggots in our bathroom near a hole at the base of the shower. Wasn't pleasant.
The breakfast was good but the selection of hot food was limited but creamy mushrooms seemed to be a thing.
I wouldn't say it was 4 stars

When we walked to the hotel and checked in we was then made aware the parking garage was directly beneath the hotel with a direct access lift.  This information could be updated to the call centre.",10

2997,ibis Liege Centre Opera,,"The big problem with this hotel is their centrally controlled air con system, which did not seem to be working well enough, and the windows in our room were hermetically sealed. We were sweltering in this breathless room and couldn't sleep - I had to call reception at about midnight who swiftly moved us to a room where the windows opened. I'd never normally complain like this but it was like being suffocated. Big relief and a much better night's sleep (although the new bathroom smelled slightly of smoke!). The hotel is nice, clean, spacious, well located and people are friendly, but the temperature control was a total deal breaker. 
There was also no apology at any stage, or explanation. Reception check in was also slow as they only had one person on the desk.",5.4

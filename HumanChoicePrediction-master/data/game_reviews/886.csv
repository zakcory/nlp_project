18127,Jam Hotel,Good for families that need a short term place to stay,"Rooms are small. To put five people in one room is a bit much with the size of the room being what it is. Additionally, the room is positioned on the street side and you can hear the street car and every other noise throughout the day and evening. Definitely not sound proof from the heavy traffic and a very uncomfortable to get a decent nights sleep.",8.3

18347,Jam Hotel,Breakfast was fine. The gameroom in the basement is really nice. The top floor cafe is awesome. Rooms are perfect.,Personnel in the groundfloor cafe was really unfriendly and was did a poor job in hospitalizing a large group that clearly just arrived and didn't know the place yet. One minor detail about the rooms: We had only 2 towels in our 4 person room.,7.5

18648,Jam Hotel,The location was nice,"The pool was overcrowded and really dirty. I expected them to clean it overnight for the day after but when I went to the pool the day after in the morning, it was still the same, disgusting. In this period of Covid, I would expect a little effort.",2

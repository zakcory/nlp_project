14661,Hotel Professor,Nice but quite basic hotel in a perfect location. Friendly and helpfull staff. Simple but sufficient breakfast. Considering the very reasonable price it's good value for your money.,It was pretty noisy at night since there are quite a few bars and clubs in the immediate vicinity and the room didn't have soundproof windows.,8.8

14715,Hotel Professor,Very friendly people working there! The breakfast was very good and the Hotel literally is in the middle of the city - you couldn't be more central and you can reach everything by foot!,"Its rather loud because its surrounded by clubs and bars. Not the Hotels fault, but it was tough to get a full night of sleep.",7.9
14633,Hotel Professor,"location is perfect, staff is friendly, good price/quality","it's a rather basic hotel, it could use a make-over. Was very warm in our room (no airco) and too noisy with the window open. However, there was a fan and with window closed we heard nothing (so that was good).",7.1
14572,Hotel Professor,"People are kind and helpful and they provide a "" paied"" transport service to Brussles airport if you has a late flight and no transportation avaliable after 10 pm.
Room was clean.
Toilet was clean and roomy.
Super fast WiFi in the room.
For me the location was extra super perfect (i had a confrence in University city hall exactly the next door ).
It is close to a lot of services and the street is full of resturants.
","There was no air condition
The bed linen and coverings were not cotton and that made me sweat a lot at night and interrupted my sleep
The satillite TV was not connected
The bath tub had no curtaines and its a mess if you had shower.
The wall blugs were not comopatible with my charger  (photo provided)

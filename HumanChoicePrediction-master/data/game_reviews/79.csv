1702,Apartment Aurora,"Host available when we needed her. Great location, although a little noisy (building work started before 7am which seemed a bit much). Lovely comfy beds and plenty of pillows and towels, even toiletries if needed. Well equipped kitchen and plenty of space. Central location.",The building work started early but won't go on long I suspect. Bit noisy when cars went past but the central location more than made up for this. Lovely to stay somewhere on a par with our family home.,9.2

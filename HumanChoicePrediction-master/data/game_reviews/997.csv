25063,Strandhotel De Haan,The location is perfect (on the beachfront),It is a 2* hotel so expectations are not that high.,7
25077,Strandhotel De Haan,"The location of this hotel is perfect. You simply cannot get closer to the beach and the promenade of De Haan, as you are right on it. The rooms are ok but not great and the windows could do with some double insulation (although this of no concern in summer obvilously). The hospitality was good and breakfast was fine. Because of the current Covid measures it is impossible to rate the quality of the restaurant. However, if open the view from it would very good.","The rooms were ok - but they are really basic and the outfitting shows it age. Again, this is not a problem in summer when you're outdoors anyway.",7
25176,Strandhotel De Haan,"medium level Hotel which definitely needs maintenance, we had the room at the bottom which seemed to be a veranda in the past renewed in '90th/'00th with carpet on the floor, spot lights and a nice living area with two couches and a desk but unfortunately not separated from the bed room, it was very big but also extremely warm even if outside temperature was 18 ¬∞C, likely there was a little portable air-co which supplied to the lack of windows. The toilet was big as well, two sinks, bathtub but the WC and the bathtub were dirty. Very good breakfast with sea view, we really appreciated the smoked salmon, very good!",lack of window and dirty bathroom,7
25220,Strandhotel De Haan,"De Haan beach area is really nice. Perfect location of the Hotel! Right on the beach. Parking in De Haan is free. The Hotel is not new nor fancy, it rather could get a little makeover, BUT it was clean, the location awesome, the staff very friendly and the breakfast buffet was really good and more then enough to eat.",,9.2
25297,Strandhotel De Haan,Location is amazing. Price is OK with breakfast included.,"Uncomfy, really warm in the room (no AC) and loud outside when window open. Breakfast only served from 8.30 to 9.30AM. Rooms definitely need to be updated (everything from the beds and pillows to the carpets etc..)",5.4
25270,Strandhotel De Haan,The host was nice. It is right beside a lovely beach in a lovely town easily accessible by road or tram.,"Overall the hotel is in need of a major refurbishment, the rooms are old-fashioned and small",4

12294,B&B Brouwhuys,Charlotte and her husband Kristoph are great hosts. Charlotte provided an excellent breakfast and went to great lengths to accommodate our coeliac friend.  Comfortable ensuite rooms with a lovely lounge/dining room and garden for common use with the other guests in the three room B&B.  Excellent honesty bar from their brewery next door. Kristoph has extensive knowledge of brewing and is happy to share - both verbally and by tour if you are interested. We were! They also have a tasting room in the brewery that opens as a low key pub on Saturday until 6.  B&B is on the route 4 bus into town that goes to the train station too. A wonderful welcome and an excellent stay. We will be back!,Nothing - we could have stayed longer than our 4 nights!,9.6

12132,B&B Brouwhuys,"Fantastic 2 days in Bruges. Our hosts were always on hand if needed, from providing an efficient check-in to comprehensive instructions about parking, directions into town and places to eat. Bed and room was very comfortable. The breakfast selection was amazing! great start to both days with plenty croissant, coffee and cheese :) plus homemade apple juice! They are next to a brewery but didn't get a chance to try the beer this time.","It is a good 20/25 minute walk into town, and nothing really to blame on anyone - just something to be aware.",9
12318,B&B Brouwhuys,The owners were super friendly and went out of their way to make us feel happy. Delicious breakfast every morning while we got loads of useful information on the city.,,9.2
12210,B&B Brouwhuys,"Charlotte went the extra mile for us and dropped us off at the bus station AT 4AM!!! She also waited for us with the AC on (we arrived during a heatwave). The rooms are extremely clean, the breakfast is rich and accommodates any need (even gluten free). The house is lovely, within 15min walk from the heart of the old city (nice evening stroll), but there is a bus station in front of the house if you choose not to walk. Visit their brewery and try all their beers, they're excellent!",,9.6

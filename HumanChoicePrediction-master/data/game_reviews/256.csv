14283,B&B Number 11 Exclusive Guesthouse,"It was absolutely perfect. The room is beautifully decorated, so much attention to detail. Even though you are only a 5 minute walk away from some of the main attractions, it is completely quiet. The garden is a hidden gem. The hostess was extremely kind and helpful. I can highly recommend this guest house. ",,10

14009,B&B Number 11 Exclusive Guesthouse,"We loved everything about B&B 11 Exclusive Guesthouse.  The location was close to the main square and easy to get to.  My husband and I stayed in the 1st floor suite.  It had a separate entrance, living room, small kitchen, large bedroom and bathroom.  It was extremely clean and the hosts of the B&B were wonderful.  We enjoyed breakfast each morning and great conversation with other guest.  The host of the B&B provided great instruction on what to do and see along with options for restaurants.  The next time we visit Brugge we will definitely stay at B&B 11.",We liked everything about B&B 11 Exclusive Guesthouse.,9.6

14245,B&B Number 11 Exclusive Guesthouse,"Really loved the location, tucked away from the hustle and bustle but close to the city centre and attractions. Staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was really lovely. ",The bed was quite uncomfortable as were the pillows. Perhaps if a mattress topper was added to the double bed (which is two single units put together - very common and necessary in these old houses with steep stairs! Almost impossible to install a double bed) and larger pillows provided we would have had a most restful break.,8.3

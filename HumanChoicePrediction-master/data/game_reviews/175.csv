15315,B&B Aux Quatre Bonniers,The host Kathleen was the best host I have ever experienced so helpful and spoke very good English. Slept so beautifully as the area is lovely and quiet. The whole B&B was so cosy and romanatic. The breakfast was so delicious a lot of it homemade. Loved having a sauna in the room. Just could not fault our stay at all and would definitely stay again if in this area.,,10

15213,B&B Aux Quatre Bonniers,"It's personal, it's cosy and in a large country house among sloping hills.
Lovely place with welcoming hosts that make connections to all guests.
The real grandeur has gone,  but loads of charm and character have remained.
If you like a snoring fireplace and an homemade breakfast among a dozen of other benefits, this is the place to be.
Large rooms, comfy beds, good WiFi and local produce sum it up.
Dogs more welcome than young children is also worth something nowadays..
More books in the house than anyone can read in entire winter, so bad weather will make you read from paper again..","Anyone not liking this place prefers chain hotels and all-inclusive travel solutions probably.

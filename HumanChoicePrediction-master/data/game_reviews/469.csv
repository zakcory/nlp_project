7051,Flandria Hotel,"Seriously super friendly and helpful staff, especially Charlotte! Good location.","I've found photos here a bit misleading - the room and bathroom didn't look that nice at all. Housekeeping could be improved and the sheets which are thorn should be thrown away.. Also, the walls and doors are very thin - we could hear some guys rambling, talking loudly and slamming doors at 5:30 am when walking back and forth between the (shared, I guess) bathroom and room(s) for like an hour..  There were some rain paddles on the rooftop/terrace, so we kept the windows closed during the day to keep mosquitos away, but housekeepers left them open every time which let plenty of mosquitos inside. Kind of annoying :(",6.7

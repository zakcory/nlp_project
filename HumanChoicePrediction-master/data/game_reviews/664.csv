4539,Hotel Boterhuis,Lovely welcome.  All the staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble.,I found the bed uncomfortable I am afraid due to a very poorly fitting and crackly mattress protector.,9
4483,Hotel Boterhuis,"Location, location.  Near Market square and several excellent restaurants, yet not in the most crowded areas so quiet at night. Great breakfast. Very cordial staff.  Our family of four got two rooms and they adjoined and one was very spacious, the other not too small.","The photos led me to believe that the gracious curved and arched exterior was the hotel entrance. Actually it is a view down a side street next to the hotel.  It's an old hotel made of multiple buildings so we had to go through hallways, out back through a courtyard, then into another building and up some very steep narrow stairs to get to our rooms.",7.5

4086,Hotel Boterhuis,"The location is perfect, the hotel is situated on a main road into Bruges city centre, our room was at the back, there's a church opposite which rang the bells from 8am every hour. Breakfast is included and they take your every need into account, very friendly, they give you a free map of the city and mark any location you want to visit","The only thing that we didn't like was our shower didn't stay in the right position it kept dropping down, so we had to tie it up with a plastic bag",9.6

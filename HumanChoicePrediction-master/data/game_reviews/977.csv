22413,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,The place was not as pretty and amazing looking as the pictures suggest.  but overall for the price it was good value for money - the location was great and the check in was super easy.  despite the location it felt very safe.,"The sofa etc was not quite clean and the kitchen was only equiped with the minimum such as 4 plates, 4 glasses  like the rest of the house really: 1 towel per person and only one bedside light per room.  it wasnt a problem but just gave a feeling of only providing the basics.",6

So it doesn't matter wether you're in the kitchen or living room.","The public rooms were not clean and there was a very bad smell (We needed to hold our breaths during the elevator ride).

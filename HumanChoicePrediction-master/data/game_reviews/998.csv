Staff was friendly. Good breakfast buffet.","Difficult to find the hotel as it cannot be reached by car. Park your car on the big parking lot for free, and walk to the hotel. No reception, receive your room key at the bar. Room could be cleaner We tried the restaurant but we were not impressed.",8
25187,Strandhotel De Haan,"The buffet breakfast with the view to the beach - was a fantastic view. The hotel makes their own breads-very delicious. They have 4 course menu with good price. The hotel is at the beach and very nice view from the bedroom. Very kind and friendly staff. Parking spaces are behind the hotel free of charge.  De Haan and its beach promenade is very nice. Easily reachable to small shops and bakeries. This hotel needs 3 stars!  This place is also good for weekends, short and long holidays!  We recommend to try this hotel.  We will come back again. Thank you very much!","There is nothing to say, except the buffet breakfast is open from 8:30 to 9:30 am, which is bit short. It would be nice to have breakfast open for about 2 hours at least as the travelers go for holidays or relaxing.",8.8

7062,Hostellerie de la Chapelle,"The place was lovely, set in an old abbey I believe. You should opt to eat here as the food is fantastic and fresh each day. Staff, family run, were very nice and helpful. It's in a good location to explore the region and was good to come back to hotel for a great dinner each night. The location is just outside Malmedy so you need a car or bicycle to visit town center. ",WiFi was not good because of the thick walls of the building but if you want to unplug it's perfect.,9.6

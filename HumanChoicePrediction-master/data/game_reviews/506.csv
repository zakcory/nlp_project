9051,Guest House Huyze Die Maene,Great location.  Center of old town on the market square.,"We asked about a taxi the night before we left, as we needed to be at the train station by 8:30. We asked for a taxi at 8:00 am.  The staff said they would arrange the taxi for us.  We went down in the morning at 8:00 and no taxi.  We asked the one staff person there, but she could not call us a taxi.  We had no cell phone service to call ourselves.  We subsequently missed our train and has to cancel a touring stopped we planned to make.  We are very disappointed in the staff.",8.3

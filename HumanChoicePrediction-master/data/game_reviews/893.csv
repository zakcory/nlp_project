17620,Les Tanneurs,"Great location,good restaurant,close to bars,restaurants,river.",No lift to actual floors so you have to carry cases up and down a narrow winding staircase,8.8
17450,Les Tanneurs,"we arrived late after 9pm & went into restaurant at 9.30pm. Initially the maitre'd told us there was no availability, but when they realised we were late arrivals their attitude changed & we got a great steak!","As others have said, it has an odd layout wiyj lots of stairs & bends. Decor universally brown",8
17820,Les Tanneurs,Building is full of character - beautiful and quirky. Excellent location for the town centre.,Nothing.,10
17910,Les Tanneurs,"Friendly service, location close to city center. The room was very large with a nice bathroom.","Very noisy. The room was next to the restaurant and under the roof top bar. So a lot of noise until approx. 11 PM. At around 5 AM the cleaning of the restaurant floor etc. started, so not much quiet time. The pillows weren't great. Dining at the grill restaurant did not meet expectations. It sounded great, but was just about mediocre. No safe in the room.",6.7
17393,Les Tanneurs,Good breakfast and perfect location to explore the city. Nice design.,There were some reconstruction works so it got really loud in the morning. Didn't get warned before.,7.9
17956,Les Tanneurs,,"Initially we were placed in a room with broken air conditioning, the unit dripped directly onto the bed. It was obvious they were aware as there was an extra fan in the room.  We we called the front desk they did move us but initially threatened that if we moved that night we would just have to move rooms the next day. In the end we were able to keep our new room but it could have been handled better by the staff",4

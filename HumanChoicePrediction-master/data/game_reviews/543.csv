13917,"Holiday Inn Express Hasselt, an IHG Hotel",Good value place to stay. Beds comfy. Clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Nearby underground parking cost 2 euros per hour (1 euro per hr evening) up to maximum 16 euros within 24 hrs.,"Discovered what other reviewers meant when they said it was hard to find this place due to one way system.  There were 3 of us in car navigating using both car Satnav and google maps on phone, but stymied by ongoing roadwork disruptions.   In the end we ditched the car somewhere near enough to hotel and walked, got map & instructions from hotel staff about how to find the underground parking.  Thankfully didn't get parking ticket meantime. Could do with some better access instructions when booking.",9.2

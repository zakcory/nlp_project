12555,Hotel Esperance,There was nothing good about this hotel,There were no air conditioner and they call it as a three star hotel !!! I think even 1 star is too much for this place. NEVER GO THERE.,4.6

11790,Hotel Esperance,"Room 12 on 4th floor was comfortable. Staff very friendly. Good location between metro Brouckere and Rogier, not far from the North station. Nice art deco elements in reception/breakfast area.","All was ok, just good to know: every guest receives a message a few days before your stay that says 'Check in is 3 PM', while the hotel means check in FROM 3 PM (so only if you want to check in before 3 PM you pay 10 euro extra). Beware there is no elevator in this hotel, while it has four floors (rooms 9-12 are on the 4th floor).",7
11782,Hotel Esperance,"Nice bar downstairs, v friendly and helpful staff. ",Only one key to room. Soundproofing from floor to floor not great. Room was v compact.,7
11967,Hotel Esperance,"I like the design of the room, the area of the room is large. The staff is very friendly and the location near to the station about 15 minutes on foot. The environment and the furniture are good.","If there is a dustbin in living room maybe be better. Every time I want throw something I should go to the toilet or the washing room. And if it could be check in early is better. Because somebody usually arrive at noon, the check in time of the hotel is 15:00, it be charged if I checkin in advance.",8.8

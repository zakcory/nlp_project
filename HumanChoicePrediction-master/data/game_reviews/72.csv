18060,Aparthotel Trilogie,Beautiful place. Great value,Didn't sleep too well. A bit noisy on main road . Just need to sort decent pillows.,9.6
18048,Aparthotel Trilogie,"Our apartment was beautifully equipped and spotlessly clean and cared for. The staff who we met were friendly, efficient and incredibly helpful throughout our stay, and really made us welcome. The location in Flanders is perfect for touring the beautiful towns of Ieper and Poperinghe, and very close to all of the major Great War museums, battlefields, memorials and places of interest. Kemmel village itself is a beautiful, lively and friendly place, well equipped with places to eat and drink and to buy provisions. We will definitely stay here next time we visit Flanders.","We could not fault the accommodation, staff or the location.",10

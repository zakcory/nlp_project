15846,Thon Hotel Brussels City Centre,,There was construction all around the hotel and booking.com did not mention that which I found very decieving. After I complained to booking.com I received a call from a very polite young man who said that they contacted the hotel and that the hotel will be in touch with me. Of course the hotel did not get in touch with me and the staff had no idea what I was talking about and couldnt care less.  At the check in I had to change the room 2 times because the rooms were not clean or had a defekt.,4.2

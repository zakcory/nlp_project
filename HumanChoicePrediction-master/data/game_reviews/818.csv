3196,Hotel Montovani,"Great location 5-10min walk from the centre. It's a small hotel and it feels very relaxed. The staff were really helpful and when we arrived to drop our bags off at 10am, the room was already clean and they let us check-in straight away. This was lovely as after travelling overnight by boat, it was great to have a shower before exploring.
The breakfast was simple but more than you need. Nice breads and cereals with the usual meat, cheese and egg accompaniments. It was also nice to eat in the conservatory which in the summer I imagine it lovely.
Comfy bed, hot and and powerful shower too. All for a great price. ","Nothing, I would definitely stay again.",10

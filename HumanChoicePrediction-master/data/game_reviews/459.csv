2086,Faubourg Saint Martin,"I loved the old building, it had a lot of character. The location was great only a few minutes away from the city center. The beds were very comfy.",The bathroom wasn't that great. It was hard to take a shower and not have water dripping on the floor. Dripping is an understatement. Also the bathroom was in front of the room and it was not possible to close the door to the outside. We where by our selfs but if there are a lot of guest I woud not like the idea someone could just run into your bathroom.,8

2264,Faubourg Saint Martin,It's a wonderful house located in front of the Saint-Martin church. The outside doesn't say much but once inside it's a real gem. The rooms are well decorated and are very comfortable. The view of Liege from the garden is amazing.,"Even if located very close to the city center (5min walking distance), be prepared to walk uphill or climb hundreds of stairs. But it's worth it ;-)",10

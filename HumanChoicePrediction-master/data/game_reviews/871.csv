8633,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"The breakfast for a youth hostel was really good. Fresh fruits, three sorts of jam, ham and cheese. The staff was super kind and nice they also have their honest opinion on tours for example which I think is always gold worth!","Actually I think I was in one of the oldest rooms of the hostel. The room could have been a bit more clean. There were some hairs from a previous visitor left in the closet. And the one with the blanket is still like this (only a sheet and a normal inlet). If you know it, you can arrange and I think that the reason is because of the heat during the summer. So please understand this as a neutral point!  The location might be in the centrum but it's still everytime a quick fifteen minute walk so maybe it's better for a solo traveller to stay closer inside.",7.9
8474,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,Location good. Walkable to town centre without being stuck there.,"Kitchen use limited to specific hours. Could not cook breakfast in morning, or make tea after 2200. 4 bed room felt small with 4 adults. Limited indoor places to sit. Bar had loud music so difficult to Skype. Staff variable. excellent to indifferent. Good place for school groups. Terrace will be good in warm weather. Little atmosphere for independent travellers.",7.9

The fact that it had a vending machine with water at 1$. Great deal. ","The sheets were a little bit dirty. 
The people from other rooms were making a lot of noises at night, although it was a rule for no noise after 10 PM.  ",7.9

8988,Jacques Brel Youth Hostel,"Very tidy room, the personnel is really professional and the general building is awesome. Really cheap price, can't ask for much more.","The plugs in the rooms should be more than one and close to each bed. The breakfast was very ""basic"", I suggest including some more types of dishes, even with a small fee.",8.3

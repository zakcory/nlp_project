202,Hotel Saint Sauveur by WP Hotels,Great location very close to the beach and shopping streets. Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby as well. Very friendly and attentive staff. The breakfast was good many things to choose from.,"The hotel has been recently renovated but in our room there were many things that were not in top shape - bathroom door could not be closed and handle was falling off. The mattress was not comfortable it was very thin. The hotel is located in a pedestrian zone so you cannot access it directly by car which makes it difficult to unload and load your car, especially challenging when you have a small child with you.",6
88,Hotel Saint Sauveur by WP Hotels,"Croissants was actually very nice, location very good.","Hotel advertises they have parking, only when I got to the hotel I was told I had to book and I have to park in public car park 5 minutes away and pay 22 euros per day. It was quiet upsetting when I looked at the booking email and found it at the very bottom of long email I had to pre-book in advance, booked this hotel because it said has parking :(. Also hotel says is 4 stars, sorry but that's not true, fairly 3 stars. Room needs a refurbishment, clean corridors and lift.",6

14312,B&B Chester,"We liked the convenience of this location in proximity to the shops and main square.  The property is decorated in a clean, modern chic with relaxing earth tone colors and tasteful furnishings and artwork.  Stephanie rode her bike to the property to meet us and explain the key system, etc. in a timely manner.  Parking our car in a nearby garage worked out well, and the location was walkable for all of the tourist areas of Bruges.  Breakfasts were beautifully displayed and we had a lot of carb options to pick from, as well as freshly prepared eggs.  Overall, it was a lovely choice for our two-day visit to Bruges.",,10

12281,B&B Salve,"This B&B was beyond expectation; the host made us feel like we'd be her personal guests rather than just hiring an accommodation. Its location is not at the city centre, but getting there with public transportation is rather quick & easy and if one is driving, parking infront of the house is free. The area is quiet and safe. The nearest restaurants are a few minutes walk away.",,10

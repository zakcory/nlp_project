2605,Steigenberger Wiltcher's,"Location, hotel building, and specious suite rooms","Looks like hotel is under staff specially when you arrive at night only 1 bellboy we waited long time for our car and baggages to be collected. Reception Staff are unfriendly, poor buffet for five star hotel. One time we asked for extra water bottles for our young kids they refused and suggested to use mini bar instead which I find it outrageous as none of our hotels we stayed refused such request in fact they were offering us without asking.

7050,Aloft Brussels Schuman,"Room was a great size, comfy bed, excellent wifi that worked the full 3 days after logging in once. Friendly staff. Liked the lobby/lounge/bar area which has different seating options and was a great place to do some work or have a beer.","Room only had one type of curtain (to keep any light out). Great during the night but as there are other buildings really close you had to also close them during the day to avoid neighbors looking into the room. A second, thinner curtain would have helped. The hotel signature smell (perfume) was really strong in the lobby and after room service.",8

Also it's nice to have tea in the room. ",Breakfast was a little dissapointing. Also there is the feeling that it lacks of air in the corridors and the room.,8

6317,Aris Grand Place Hotel,Very central location and nice staff. Soap and shampoo from Rituals.,"It so central but the sound isolation is not good enough. There is noisy all the day. We stayed in a king room and there was no quiter room. Poor breakfast. Very old building, should be renovated asap! The bathroom was very old, broken walls and bathtube. The bed quite comfortable but not the pillows. It is a ok choice but very expensive for whatvyou get.",6.3

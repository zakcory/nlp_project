7955,All In One,"Very central - easy access to the train to the Brussels Airport as we had an early departure. Great welcome - clearly a keen aesthetic sense as the property has some beautiful art, furniture and finishes. We will come back for longer next time.",Lots of stairs which is a pain with big bags but that is the nature of inner city living. We were travelling for a month so had a fair bit of gear to deal with.,10

7939,All In One,"Great place. Very nice host and comfortable working space. Good beds and facilities; good coffee to take to needs, decent wifi and nice atmosphere.",The only small downside was that the area is a bit noisy. A pub downstairs was not a problem since rooms are on top floor but some rooms are quieter than others.,9.6
8003,All In One,"A lovely place with lovely people in a great location. If you're driving you need to park in the city2 shopping Centre then use the app to go outside. The sign is small, it's beside a pub.
We had a wonderful stay and wished we stayed longer ",,10

7684,All In One,"A beautiful premise with an amazing and kind hostess.  The place is gorgeous, very well located (right in the center of Brussels) and the accommodations are top notch. I can't think of a single thing that could be improved, even the specific measures against Covid are well thought and efficient. Would come back again anytime ! Thanks a lot Vinciane :)",I can't think of anything.. It was really perfect,10

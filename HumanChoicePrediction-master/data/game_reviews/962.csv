10594,Priorij Corsendonk,Great setting in an old monastery and on big grounds. Quiet location.,"The bathroom seat in Gastenkwartier room 1was old and absolutely disgusting. The room as well as the 3 course dinner are much overpriced and not value for money. One (large) bottle of water was 8 euro's, it took 2 hours for serving the same standard meal to about 20 people who were all there at the same time and though the setting was  nice the meal itself was quite plain. Overall, a disappointing experience for the accommidation as well as for the dinner.",4
